   41yo female with Bipolar d/o, h/o heroin use, Hepatitis C, recent
   history of septic joint s/p debridement admitted on [**2858-8-29**] with acute
   renal failure and mild thrombocytopenia, transferred to the MICU after
   being found cyanotic and apneic in her bed. She was aroused within 1
   minute of bag ventilation, and she did not have decreased pulse or
   blood pressure.  Upon arousal, the reports her ""associate"" was just in
   the room and injected her with heroin in her left hand.  (not through
   her current PIV). She also admits to paying for the heroin. She states
   that she was extremely depressed and anxious today, in light of her
   recent diagnosis of hepatitis C in addition to her concurrent medical
   problems. She claims to have been free of heroin use for >6 months now.
   .
   The patient originally presented with non oliguric renal failure,
   attributed to linezolid and ciprofloxacin, which she had being taking
   for right ankle septic arthritis with MRSA and enterobacter. She was
   instead switched to Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.  Her renal function
   gradually improved after cessation of ciprofloxacin and linezolid, and
   is thought to have been secondary to AIN.  The major outstanding issue
   is regarding switching her from IV to PO antibiotics, as the patient
   had been opposed to discharge with IV antibiotics and there does not
   appear to be an appropriate PO regimen.

   Ms [**Known patient lastname 3927**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic edema from multiple
   intubations, HTN, DM, and ESRD, who was found unresponsive at her
   nursing home today.  Per the patient's daughter and nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 429**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she had been in her USOH, which included mild stridor since her
   recent discharge from [**Hospital1 52**].  Starting on Sunday ([**6-27**]), her daughter
   noticed she seemed more ""out of breath"" than usual.  She was started on
   albuterol/ipratropium with good effect.  On Wednesday [**6-30**] the patient
   became acutely uncomfortable, complaining that something was ""stuck in
   her throat"".  She was noted to be restless, stridorous, and clutching
   her throat at the time.  She was given a one-time dose of benadryl, and
   suddenly dropped her O2 sats to 87% on 6L NC, became unresponsive and
   ""limp"".  She maintained a pulse throughout.  EMS was called and the
   patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 52**]. Of note, the patient was stopped on
   lisinopril/valsartan on her last admission for concern that angioedema
   may have contributed to her stridor.  She was restarted on valsartan on
   [**6-28**] when her symptoms worsenened.
   .
   In the emergency department the patient was afebrile, SBPs ranged from
   198-240, HR in the 50s, RR 15.  She was started on a labetalol drip for
   hypertension.  She was intubated for airway protection and was noted to
   have a difficult airway.  Serum tox, cardiac enzymes, CBC were all
   wnl.  A head CT, CXR, CT neck and torso were completed and were all
   grossly wnl, except for a non-perfusing left vertebral artery.  She was
   given 1g of CTX, 1g of vancomycin, and 500mg of metronidazole despite
   not having fevers, leukocytosis or any focal signs of infection.  She
   was pan cultured.  She was noted to have coffee ground emesis through
   her OG tube, with guiac negative stools, and was given 40mg of IV
   pantoprazole.

   became lethargic the last couple days. Also hypoventilation became an
   issue for unclear etiology. In this setting patient underwent CTA chest
   on [**8-16**] which showed no evidence for PE, but did show atelectasis and
   large left sided effusion which appeared as an unchanged effusion .
   Lethargy improved off seroquel. Still hypoventilating, was evaluated by
   ENT, nothing wrong with trach site, vocal cords moving well, received
   few doses of decadron. Concern was for recurrent aspiration and Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1876**] tried doing PEG tube. No BiPap in last 24 hours.
   He was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 3877**] ICU for chief complaint of
   altered mental status and his ICU stay was from [**8-11**]-present. The
   patient had some intermittent bouts of delerium and insomnia which have
   been reasonably controlled with Seroquel and medication adjustments. He
   had marked hypercalcemia on [**3130-8-14**] which was attributed to
   immobilization and this hypercalcemia was thought to be partly
   responsible for some of his confusion and altered mentation. This was
   treated with some bisphosphonates to encourage bone Calcium
   reabsorption. During the same timeframe the patient experienced a
   dramatic drop in his oxygen saturations from high 90s down to 75% which
   improved once he was placed on 5L O2 via NC. He had a BP 174/84, HR 120
   RR26 at this time and was c/o SOB. On exam he had decreased lung sounds
   at bases and was coughing up white sputum. BP peaked at 192/84 and RR
   increased to 38. ABG was pH 7.12/103/87 and patient placed on BIPAP
   25/5 with 60% FiO2, he then became hypotensive and got IVFs to restore
   his BP. He recovered and was placed on NC with oxygen sats returning to
   90s. Pt had hypernatremia over last few days treated w/free water
   flushes.
   Noteable studies: He had CXR which showed no signs massive aspiration
   but atelectasis on LLL and additional Chest CT showed left pleural
   effusion.  Sputum culture showed gram negative rods on [** Location **] report.
   C. diff culture was negative and EKG showed HR 86, early repolarization

208,28827,"ADMISSION NOTE
   This is a 60 M with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV ,. Presented to ED on
   [**3-21**] and was admitted  with cough, leukocytosis and hypotension.  He
   was initially complaining of overall malaiase and worsening L shoulder
   and knee pain for which he had been taking increased opiates. Of note,
   he was recently admitted from [**3-6**] to [**3-14**] with respiratory distress and
   was found to have a RML/RLL pna for which he completed a 10 day course
   of ctx/azithro. During  last admission tunnel cath was placed and pt
   was started on HD.
    In the ED he became transiently hypotensive and responded to volume.
   In the ED, he was restarted on CTX and azithro for a possible CAP, and
   Vanco and Flagyl were added for a possible biliary source of infection
   after the patient was found to also have a new transaminitis. CT
   abd/pelvis in the ED was unremarkable for source.
   .
   On the floor, abx were expanded to vanc/zosyn for HAP given
   leukocytosis, hypotension. Low grade temperature to 100.2.  He has been
   intermittently oriented on x2 with somnolence.  No ABGs had been done
   prior.  BPs stable from 94-120 systolic with HRs in the 70s-90s.  He
   was on 2-3L NC.  Stools had been guaiac negative, has had reasonable
   urine output, las HD session was [**3071-3-21**].  He had rec'd his home
   oxycontine 40 mg on the morning of [**3-21**], though further opiates were
   held due to somnolence.   He was also found to have a decreasing
   platelet count, and due to concern for HIT, he was placed on
   Argatroban, dosed for hepatic disease.
   .
   On the morning of MICU transfer, the patient was found to be more
   somnolent than prior but arousable.  ABG showed 7.24/76/94.  At that
   time, given somnolence, he was transferred to the ICU for likely BiPap
   and further management.
   .
   Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient is easily arousable and moaning
   in pain.  He is refusing BiPap, and he is not oriented or appropriate
   enough to consent or refuse intubation.  He is unable to provide his
   sister's phone number though he is making a concerted effort.  He is

   chronic kidney disease (BL Cr 1.8), and recent hospitalization at OSH
   for infected gouty arthritis who was admitted from rehab on [**3219-5-13**]
   with scrotal cellulitis to OSH, transferred here for hemoptysis, SOB,
   chest pain, and EKG wtih ST depressions in lateral leads.  Overnight,
   he experienced further hemoptysis with acute onset of SOB, tachypnea,
   and was transferred to the MICU.
   Patient was first admitted to [**Hospital3 5151**] Hospital on [**3219-4-20**]
   with right lower extremity infected gouty arthritis and hemoptysis in
   the setting of an INR of 9.  The 1st right MP joint was aspirated and a
   right foot xray and MRI were negative for osteomyelitis. He ultimatedly
   treated wtih prednisone taper for gout in addition to IV Vancomycin for
   presumed MRSA infection. His INR was reversed with vitamin K.  AFB was
   negative.  Pulmonary felt the hemoptysis was secondary to pneumonia.
   Follow-up CXR showed a resolving RLL infiltrate.  He was discharged to
   rehab on [**3219-5-7**] on a 7 day course of Keflex with diagnoses of UTI and
   right foot super infected MSSA gouty arthritis (uric acid level 8.4).
   On [**5-11**], he was readmitted from rehab to OSH with scrotal cellulitis.
   He was started on 3g [**Hospital1 **] Unasyn with improvement.  Then on [**3219-5-12**], he
   started to experience hemoptysis, SOB, and chest pain. An EKG showed ST
   depressions in the lateral leads and troponins were trending up: 0.11
   --> 0.18.  An echo done on [**3219-5-12**] at the OSH showed LVEF 35-40% (BL
   55%) and global LV hypo kinesis.  He also went into pulmonary edema,
   received 80 mg IV Lasix.  At [**Hospital1 5**], he continued to have hemoptysis
   multiple times per day.  He was initially on a heparin gtt for NSTEMI
   and new finding of L posterior tibia vein thrombosus.  CTA showed ""1.
   No pulmonary embolism. 2. Extensive pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.
   No obvious bleeding site with the exception of possible incipient
   broncholiths in the right hilus.  Pulmonary was consulted, felt the
   ddx-included pneumonia, AVN, malignancy, pHTN/MR/CHF.  Per OSH records,
   anti-GBM was negative.  Bronchoscopy was planned.   On [**5-15**], he
   triggered for non-massive hemoptysis, desaturations to 88%, and
   respiratory distress.  His symptoms were relieved with morphine and
   Lasix.   Vanc was added for GPCs noted in sputum.  Due to this episode,
   bronchscopy was deferred.  An IVC filter was placed.  He received 1
   unit PRBcs, though HCTs have been stable at 24-25. On [**5-18**], he had
   another episode of non-massive hemoptysis, tachypnea, and tachycardia.
   He was transferred to the MICU.

   admission to [**Hospital1 1011**] and rehab for CVA (although not seen on imaging) who
   presents today with acute worsening of SOB at home.  Per her daughter,
   she feels SOB every night but it usually resolves on it's own.  Last
   night, it just got worse and so she came to the hospital.

   canula.  A room air sat was in the low 80s.  Patient was given vanco 1
   gm, unasyn 3 gm, and clinda 600 mg.  She was started on a nitro gtt for
   hypertension.  She was placed on bipap and felt more comfortable.  She
   also received zofran for nausea.  She receieved kayexcelate 30 mg PO x1
   as well for K of 6.1.

Per report, she then had 3 seizures prior to transfer. Details of the semiology
of these seizures is not available. She was reportedly given fosphenytoin prior
to transfer but this was not recorded. Here, pt had a complex partial with head

 status improved rapidly after the seizure over 2-3 minutes and she was able to
answer simple questions. She was oriented to person, place and year. She was als

   residing in a nursing home  found unresponsive in vomitus and asystolic
   this morning, apenic and cyanotic, he had made some gasping efforts.
   He was seen 10 minutes earlier and in no distress and at baseline.
   Apparently nursing staff noted him to be apenic and placed an AED which
   advised ""no shock"" and called EMS.  By EMS he was noted to be in a PEA
   arrest with a narrow complex tachycardia at a rate of around 100.  He
   was given epi and atropine x 2 doses each.  He never regained a pulse
   during his transport.  By the time he arrived at [**Hospital3 **] he was
   again noted to be in PEA arrest with a rate of 170-180 with occasional
   triplets of PVCs.  He was given 1mg of epi, 1 amp of bicarb and 1g of
   magnesium (for the ectopy) and he regained a pulse with a SBP of 100.

   stents who has [** Location **]usly refused CABG, SSS s/p PPM who transferred
   from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] with chest pain.
    He has known 3 vessel CAD with a tight LAD lesion found in [**6-12**]. No
   intervention was made at the time, since patient declined CABG.  He was
   admitted on [**10-14**] for worsening chest pain. He was initially presented
   to [**Location (un) 3**] and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**2504-10-14**].
   .
   His chest pain was attributed to his known disease. He had already been
   on maximal medical therapy at home and this was continued during
   hospitalization. He continued to have daily chest pain consistent with
   stable disease.. He was planned to undergo catheterization today.
   During this hospitalization he was noted to be volume overloaded and
   was given furosemide for diuresis. Notably, after diuresis he developed
   worsening renal failure with cre from 1.2 to 2.9. This has been
   trending down to 2.1 since then (renal is following). Urine lytes have
   been consistent with prerenal failure. A renal US negative though has a
   mass in his bladder which likely caused hematuria during this
   admission. He has been very sensitive to fluid boluses with
   desaturations.. His hematocrit has been stable in mid 30s. His PTT has
   been elevated to 60s, with unclear etiology.
   .
   Given his extensive CAD he was taken to cath lab on [**10-27**]  with
   revascularization of LAD with rotathrectomy and the placement of two
   cypher DES under assistance of tandem heart placement during procedure.
   Because he remained hemodynamically stable, the tandem heart was
   discontinued and his 15 French sheath was pulled. He then experienced a
   transient drop in blood pressure and was noted to have a right groin
   hematoma. He received 2 units pack red blood cells.

   76  R 20  98%3L. He was given 4.5L NS with no response in his BP. His
   labs were notable for new acute renal failure. CE's were elevated, Trop
   to 0.17 in the setting of sepsis and renal failure. The patient had a
   penile prosthesis and was unable to be catheterized in the ED for a UA.
   A bedside bladder scan showed several hundred cc's in the bladder but
   no distention and urology was called. A CXR was unremarkable, CT
   abd/pelvis did not show free air and an EKG was obtained. The ED wanted
   to place a CVL to initiate pressors for septic shock, but the family
   reiterated the patient's wishes for DNR/DNI and no procedures, however
   was is agreeable to peripheral pressors and ICU admission for 24 hours.
   He was started on Levophed, but became bradycardic and was then
   switched to Dopamine for ? cardiogenic shock. He was given a dose of
   Vanco & Zosyn and admitted to the MICU for further management.

   A fib on coumadin and DM type 2 presented to OSH with fatigue,
   weakness, cough and subjective fever. The week prior he was admitted to
   an outside facility for weakness which was thought to be secondary to
   inderal dosing.  The patient saw his outpatient cardiologist following
   discharge, asked to wear a holter monitor which showed 3 second pauses.
   On the day of admission([**3-9**]) to [**Hospital3 53**] Hospital, the patient's
   daughter found him lying on the floor, unable to stand on his own.  He
   denies any LOC at that time.  His initial vital signs were T 100.7, HR
   102 (irregular) and BP 158/90.  Treated for a PNA with levaquin,

   HPI:
   51 y.o. female with a past medical history of remote Hodgkin's s/p
   treatment and staging laparotomy and splenectomy as well as a history
   of PEs, at least one of which required TPA who is being transferred
   from [**State 4101**]Hospital to be evaluated for a liver transplant. On
   [**6-18**], at NEBH, patient underwent bilateral C6-7 laminoforaminotomies
   and C5-7 posterior cervical spinal instrumented fusion with left
   posterior iliac crest bone graft harvest through a separate incision
   for cervical spondylosis. She reportedly tolerated the procedure well.
   On [**6-20**], she then presented to [**Hospital3 **] with an acute change in
   mental status in the setting of hypotension with SBP in the 80s and a
   leukocytosis of 19 with 5% bands and lactate of 5.2 along with a
   positive UA and bibasilar infiltrates on CXR. Labs were also notable
   for acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3 and a troponin of 17,
   the latter of which led her to receive ASA and Plavix. She was given
   Levofloxacin empirically and then transferred to [**State 6498**]Hospital's MICU for further management of presumed sepsis. While at
   [**Location 6499**], patient was fluid resuscitated with improvement
   in her BP after 3 L of normal saline (seemingly never requiring
   pressors), received supportive care for her renal failure with
   Kayexalate and calcium for hyperkalemia. Creatinine however increased
   to 4 with decrease in UOP to less than 5 ccs/hour. Antibiotics for
   presumed sepsis were initiated with broad coverage through Zyvox and
   Aztreonam as patient has multiple antibiotic allergies. Culture data at
   the time of transfer was unrevealing. Cardiac enzymes were followed and
   trended down to 14 (troponin, but CKs not checked). A TTE was performed
   which was very limited and commented on possible enlarged RV. Chest CT
   without contrast commented on possible dissection, but follow-up MRI
   showed no dissection. Given AST of [**Numeric Identifier 6500**] and ALT of [**Numeric Identifier 6501**], INR of 2.7
   with worsening mental status, GI was consulted and was concerned for
   significant encephalopathy (grade 3). She was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for consideration of liver transplant and in the interim once accepted,
   was intubated to protect her airway.

   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from [**Hospital3 **] ICU (per his family's request). The
   patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED on [**3133-4-26**] with generalized
   weakness, fever to 103F, lethargy, dyspnea, and was noted to have an
   oxygen saturation in the 70s on RA (no prior oxygen requirement). He
   denied N/V/D, abdominal pain, change in urinary habits, but did endorse

   leukocytosis of 14. Despite initial treatment with IV ceftriaxone,
   azithromycin, and solumedrol, the patient was unable to tolerate taper
   off nonrebreather and required BiPAP to help maintain oxygen
   saturations. Given that he appeared worse both clinically and by xray,

   failure(EF-35%/ICD placement) and severe AS(area-0.6 cm2/gradient 33mm
   Hg),s/p aortic valvuloplasty [**3-25**], who went to OSH [**11-15**] with abdominal
   pain. CT showed small bowel thickening with small amt free air. He had
   elevated WBCs and mental status changes. Follow-up CT showed no more
   air but small bowel & mestanteric inflammation.  Surgeons there felt
   intervention not necessary at that time. [**11-17**] he went to ICU with sats
   down to low 90s and was stabilized on CPAP. However he again dropped
   sats and was intubated on [**11-18**]. His troponin bumped to 5.45 and BNP was
   3030, felt to be all r/t CHF exacerbation d/t severe AS with small
   bowel perforation.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]/CCU [**11-19**] for further care. He remained
   intubated over the w/e [**Date range (1) 3255**]-receiving ABX and diuresis.  On [**11-22**]
   attempts at weaning failed. Pt  has had low grade temps (99.7-99.0)and
    Zosyn( to cover for possible bowel perforation) was changed to full
   strength (4.5mg q8,) and he  received D5W
 for hyponatremia.
   Pt was successfully extubated on [**11-23**] and PICC was placed with
   initiation of TPN.
   On [**11-24**]- pt had repeat CT which revealed a small loculated area of fluid
   vs infection so GI surgery was consulted. They felt that in order to
   proceed with GA and a lap exploration, the pt needed to undergo AVP.
   Cardiology was consulted and consented to AVP but only if pt was to
   require surgical intervention/diagnostics of abdomen and awaited
   surgical decision.
   On [**11-25**]- surgery decided to not proceed with lap exploration and
   therefore cardiology cancelled AVP for which pt was on
standby
 for
   Fri [**11-26**]. It is planned to continue to tx pt medically for his AS. He
   has remained intermittently confused and very quiet with flat affect
   since extubation by report. He denies any pain of discomfort or trouble
   breathing. Pt remains on lopressor/ lasix daily and Zosyn with stable
   VS and o2 sats on room air. His mental status remains unclear as at
   times he answers appropriately and other times is appearing confused
   and very withdrawn.
   The pt
s daughter is HCP and has been present and notified of all
   progress and plans of care and was called re: the latest idea to defer
   surgical procedure and AVP and tx pt medically..

   hyperlipidemia who had an unwitnessed fall while at home [**2-10**] and
   transported to [**Hospital3 53**] where he was intubated for airway
   protection and found to have large 5X4cm L ICH with extension into both
   lateral ventricles and 4th ventricle.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for
   further care.  He was initially seen per NSURG who did not recommend
   surgical intervention currently hence neurology was consulted.

   that he was told per PCP (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 4651**]) that he is bound to fall
   given his overall weakness from co-morbidities including ESRD for which
   he is getting 3x/week dialysis for the past 1.5 years.
   INR was 2.5 at OSH hence he received FFP and Vitamin K.His INR was 2.3

   Assessment:
   Pt most likely  became  fatigued in the setting of metabolic acidosis
   and attempt to hyperventilate to compensate requiring her to be
   intubated. Placed pt on 40% cpap with 5 peep and ps of 5 . lungs
   essentially clear on auscultation. Suctioned for sm amts of thick tan
   sputum.cxr c/w fluid overload which is likely contributing to the
   difficulty in weaning her off the vent.once pt is weaned off pressors
   will then need diuresis and hopefully pt will start to mobilize fluid.
   Action:
   Vent  weaned to 40%cpap with 5 peep and ps of 5. resp status monitored

   diagnosed mediastinal mass and has been suffering from one month of
   dyspnea, cough and progressive dysphagia to solids and eventually
   liquids. He had an outpatient workup including EGD on [**3034-11-3**] which
   showed a 20mm esophageal ulcer and gastritis. Biopsy of the ulcer was

   an 11 SI x 11 TRV x 5.6 cm AP central, posterior mediastinal mass
   impinging on the trachea and completely compressing the esophagus. On

   transbronchial biopsy of the mediastinal mass. Initially the pathology
   was read as inadequate tissue for diagnosis secondary to excessive
   necrotic debris but likely a small cell carcinoma. On [**3034-11-23**] he

   EBUS and biopsy which was non-diagnostic. Because he was dyspneic and
   unable to lie flat, he underwent rigid bronchoscopy, for which he was
   intubated. A Y-stent was placed, he had CT chest and was transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] so he could start XRT in the AM. In the meantime, pathology

   demented, unable to walk and or perform ADLs, but had eaten a full
   meal. He reportedly has had problems with swallowing his foods and has
   been noted to cough after eating and drinking. To the best of the
   wife's knowledge, he has not had any sick contacts. Today, he was noted
   to have a dyspnea and a low-grade fever and was thus brought in to the

   clarified that patient is DNR/DNI. Additionally, the patient's wife
   expressed a desire to have no central access or pressors. Given his
   dyspnea and tachypnea, BiPAP was started and the patient was more calm.
   He was admitted to the ICU for further management.

   to follow commands. The patient's wife and son were engaged in a
   lengthy conversation during which the wife revealed that she is
   confident that the patient would not want anything to prolong his life
   given his current mental status and quality of life. She and her son
   expressed a goal of keeping him comfortable with BiPAP since it had
   been started and morphine if necessary for air hunger. The wife
   eventually expressed an interest in discontinuing antibiotics since she
   felt that they were counterproductive in the goal of not prolonging his
   life. It was also decided to hold IVF.

1750,94665,"Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2825**] is a 52yo woman h/o COPD, breast cancer who presented to an
   OSH for evaluation of shortness of breath. She notes she has not been
   feeling well for several weeks when she noted pain in her back.
   Initially she was diagnosed with a muscle spasm and given pain
   mediation. When the pain did not subside she returned for further care
   and it was noted that she had a rash that appeared to be consistant
   with shingles. She describes the pain as a band from her abdomen to her
   back. She was treated with a course of valtrex which she completed and
   the rash resolved. Her pain persisted, despite treatment with oxycodone
   and vicodin. Over the last several days, the patient noted a sore
   throat and increasing oxygen requirement (she typically is on 2L O2 NC
   at home). She also noted fevers to 102 at home and decreasing O2 sats
   from 90s to 79% with ambulation. This past weekend (during storm) the
   patient was exceedingly anxious after the electricity went out. She was
   trying to find her oxygen tank and felt herself coughing so hard she
   could barely catch her breath.
   She denies having any chest pains or dizziness, N/V. She went to an OSH
   for shortness of breath and back pain. On CXR she found to have
   multifocal PNA, also notable on labs were a leukocytosis to 24, d-dimer
   1.2 (elevated). A CTA was performed however there was dye leak into the
   left hand and the test was aborted. She was given ceftriaxone and
   transfered to [**Hospital1 1**].
   On arrival, she was noted to be afebrile with BPs in 120/60s, HR 105,
   breathing in 20s, O2 sats 80s on 2L. With albuterol and ipratropium
   nebs and morphine her O2 sat was 90s on 4L and much more comfortable.
   Noted on exam were a tense compartment in L hand. Plastics was called
   to evaluate and recommended elevatation and frequent pulse checks. CT
   from the outside hospital shows multifocal PNA, however given lack of
   contrast cannot evaluate for PE. Also on CXR were 3 fractured ribs on R
   side. Notable on her labs in the ED were a leukocytosis with left
   shift, elevated bicarb. She was started on 750mg levofloxacin IV and 1L
   IVF was started prior to transfer to the MICU. On admission to ICU, she
   was afebrile with BP 130/70s, HR 103, 95% 4L O2.

   Ms. [**Hospital1 5871**] is a 59F homeless woman with DM h/o alcoholism and
   polysubstance abuse who is transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for question of
   laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
   .
   She reportedly had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 470**] for housing
   placement and ?cellulitis. She was then referred to [**Hospital 622**] Healthcare
   for further care and placement in an apartment. The day of planned
   discharge [**6-23**] pt was noted to be increasingly anxious. She was given
   diazepam without improvement. She became confused. Vitals were obtained
   showing HR in 40's, BP 100/60 and ""low O2"" which improved to 96% on
   unknown amount of supplemental O2.
   .
   In the [**Hospital1 622**] ER, she was ""somnolent"" and given narcan x1 due to
   concern for narcotics overdose (she had been taking oxycontin). She
   subsequently became agitated and was intubated for airway protection.
   Admission labs were notable for acute renal failure with Cr of 2.5
   (reportedly in 1's [** Location **]usly), K of 7.4, ABG 7.28/56/379 on 3L NC
   prior to intubation. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. CT head showed no
   CNS bleed, but evidence of an orbital floor fracture thought to be old.
   Vitals on presentation to the ICU were 98.4 P 39-42 BP 79/40-96/37 O2
   100% on AC FiO2 0.6.
   .
   She was able to wean off the ventilator rapidly. Extubation was
   attempted on [**6-25**], but within an hour she developed stridor that
   responded poorly to nebs, epinephrine, and lasix. On reintubation she
   was thought to have laryngeal edema. Seen by ENT who felt she would
   need extubation attempt in OR with setup ready for emergency crich. She
   was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for further management given lack of 24h ENT
   coverage at [**Hospital1 622**].

   s/p lobectomy, COPD on 2L at baseline, type II diabetes and
   hypertension who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab with shortness of breath.
   Per notes over the past weekend she developed upper respiratory tract
   symptoms with nasal congestion, and cough productive of thick sputum.
   She was not experiencing any fevers.  She was given increased nebulizer
   treatments with some relief.  She was not experiencing chest pain or
   pleuritic type pain.  She was not experiencing nausea, vomiting,
   abdominal pain, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or
   swelling.  She does endorse some mild diarrhea.  She says that her
   breathing has been getting progressively worse over the past three days
   despite increasing nebulizer and oxygen therapy (titrated to 4L).  She
   appeared progressively worse and EMS was called for transport to
   [**Hospital1 1**].  When EMS arrived she was complaining of shortness of breath.
   Initial oxygen saturations were in the low 80s and these improved to
   94% on a non-rebreather.  She was noted to have scant wheezes in her
   upper lung fields.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch
   block, q waves in III, avF, TWF V1-V3.  She was taken to the emergency
   room.
   In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.8 P: 113 BP: 130/84 R: 25 O2 sat: 85%

   EKG showed sinus tachycardia, left axis, right bundle branch block, TWI
   V1-V3, q waves III, avF, no change compared to prior earlier in the
   day.  She received vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1, zosyn 4.5 grams x 1,
   combivent nebulizers x 3, solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1.  She was placed on
   BIPAP with mild improvement.  She also received nitroglycerine for
   potential volume overload as well as lasix 20 mg IV x 1.  Her BNP was
   elevated at 1122.  Her WBC was 15.1 with 91% neutrophils.  She had one
   set of negative cardiac enzymes.  She was admitted to the intensive
   care unit for further management.
   On arrival to the ICU she reports that her shortness of breath has
   improved somewhat from this morning.  She denies fevers, chills, chest
   pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, dysuria,
   hematuria, leg pain or swelling.  Comes from rehab.  Has had recent
   rhinorrhea and productive cough without fevers.  Mild diarrhea at
