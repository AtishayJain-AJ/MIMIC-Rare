   HPI:
   Ms [**Known patient lastname 3927**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic edema from multiple
   intubations, HTN, DM, and ESRD, who was found unresponsive at her
   nursing home today.  Per the patient's daughter and nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 429**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she had been in her USOH, which included mild stridor since her
   recent discharge from [**Hospital1 52**].  Starting on Sunday ([**6-27**]), her daughter
   noticed she seemed more ""out of breath"" than usual.  She was started on
   albuterol/ipratropium with good effect.  On Wednesday [**6-30**] the patient
   became acutely uncomfortable, complaining that something was ""stuck in
   her throat"".  She was noted to be restless, stridorous, and clutching
   her throat at the time.  She was given a one-time dose of benadryl, and
   suddenly dropped her O2 sats to 87% on 6L NC, became unresponsive and
   ""limp"".  She maintained a pulse throughout.  EMS was called and the
   patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 52**]. Of note, the patient was stopped on
   lisinopril/valsartan on her last admission for concern that angioedema
   may have contributed to her stridor.  She was restarted on valsartan on
   [**6-28**] when her symptoms worsenened.
   .
   In the emergency department the patient was afebrile, SBPs ranged from
   198-240, HR in the 50s, RR 15.  She was started on a labetalol drip for
   hypertension.  She was intubated for airway protection and was noted to
   have a difficult airway.  Serum tox, cardiac enzymes, CBC were all
   wnl.  A head CT, CXR, CT neck and torso were completed and were all
   grossly wnl, except for a non-perfusing left vertebral artery.  She was
   given 1g of CTX, 1g of vancomycin, and 500mg of metronidazole despite
   not having fevers, leukocytosis or any focal signs of infection.  She
   was pan cultured.  She was noted to have coffee ground emesis through
   her OG tube, with guiac negative stools, and was given 40mg of IV
   pantoprazole.

   Chief Complaint:  Tx OSH for tachypnea and possible aspiration
   HPI:
   82 y/o M with h/o HTN, diabetes, atrial fib, recent CVA, s/p subtotal
   colectomy for large LGIB [**4-/3130**] with long hospital course at [**Hospital1 52**] and
   d/c to rehab. Since departure patient has had inability to swallow and
   became lethargic the last couple days. Also hypoventilation became an
   issue for unclear etiology. In this setting patient underwent CTA chest
   on [**8-16**] which showed no evidence for PE, but did show atelectasis and
   large left sided effusion which appeared as an unchanged effusion .
   Lethargy improved off seroquel. Still hypoventilating, was evaluated by
   ENT, nothing wrong with trach site, vocal cords moving well, received
   few doses of decadron. Concern was for recurrent aspiration and Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1876**] tried doing PEG tube. No BiPap in last 24 hours.
   He was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 3877**] ICU for chief complaint of
   altered mental status and his ICU stay was from [**8-11**]-present. The
   patient had some intermittent bouts of delerium and insomnia which have
   been reasonably controlled with Seroquel and medication adjustments. He
   had marked hypercalcemia on [**3130-8-14**] which was attributed to
   immobilization and this hypercalcemia was thought to be partly
   responsible for some of his confusion and altered mentation. This was
   treated with some bisphosphonates to encourage bone Calcium
   reabsorption. During the same timeframe the patient experienced a
   dramatic drop in his oxygen saturations from high 90s down to 75% which
   improved once he was placed on 5L O2 via NC. He had a BP 174/84, HR 120
   RR26 at this time and was c/o SOB. On exam he had decreased lung sounds
   at bases and was coughing up white sputum. BP peaked at 192/84 and RR
   increased to 38. ABG was pH 7.12/103/87 and patient placed on BIPAP
   25/5 with 60% FiO2, he then became hypotensive and got IVFs to restore
   his BP. He recovered and was placed on NC with oxygen sats returning to
   90s. Pt had hypernatremia over last few days treated w/free water
   flushes.
   Noteable studies: He had CXR which showed no signs massive aspiration
   but atelectasis on LLL and additional Chest CT showed left pleural
   effusion.  Sputum culture showed gram negative rods on [** Location **] report.
   C. diff culture was negative and EKG showed HR 86, early repolarization
   which was an older finding. LENIs showed no DVTs and CTPA was clear of
   any PEs. Heand and neck CT also doen during his stay and showed
   tracheal scars but no other abnormalities in airway.

   This is a 60 M with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV ,. Presented to ED on
   [**3-21**] and was admitted  with cough, leukocytosis and hypotension.  He
   was initially complaining of overall malaiase and worsening L shoulder
   and knee pain for which he had been taking increased opiates. Of note,
   he was recently admitted from [**3-6**] to [**3-14**] with respiratory distress and
   was found to have a RML/RLL pna for which he completed a 10 day course
   of ctx/azithro. During  last admission tunnel cath was placed and pt
   was started on HD.
    In the ED he became transiently hypotensive and responded to volume.
   In the ED, he was restarted on CTX and azithro for a possible CAP, and
   Vanco and Flagyl were added for a possible biliary source of infection
   after the patient was found to also have a new transaminitis. CT
   abd/pelvis in the ED was unremarkable for source.
   .
   On the floor, abx were expanded to vanc/zosyn for HAP given
   leukocytosis, hypotension. Low grade temperature to 100.2.  He has been
   intermittently oriented on x2 with somnolence.  No ABGs had been done
   prior.  BPs stable from 94-120 systolic with HRs in the 70s-90s.  He
   was on 2-3L NC.  Stools had been guaiac negative, has had reasonable
   urine output, las HD session was [**3071-3-21**].  He had rec'd his home
   oxycontine 40 mg on the morning of [**3-21**], though further opiates were
   held due to somnolence.   He was also found to have a decreasing
   platelet count, and due to concern for HIT, he was placed on
   Argatroban, dosed for hepatic disease.
   .
   On the morning of MICU transfer, the patient was found to be more
   somnolent than prior but arousable.  ABG showed 7.24/76/94.  At that
   time, given somnolence, he was transferred to the ICU for likely BiPap
   and further management.

   Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient is easily arousable and moaning
   in pain.  He is refusing BiPap, and he is not oriented or appropriate
   enough to consent or refuse intubation.  He is unable to provide his

   admitted on [**10-14**] for worsening chest pain. He was initially presented
   to [**Location (un) 3**] and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**2504-10-14**].
   .
   His chest pain was attributed to his known disease. He had already been
   on maximal medical therapy at home and this was continued during
   hospitalization. He continued to have daily chest pain consistent with
   stable disease.. He was planned to undergo catheterization today.
   During this hospitalization he was noted to be volume overloaded and
   was given furosemide for diuresis. Notably, after diuresis he developed
   worsening renal failure with cre from 1.2 to 2.9. This has been
   trending down to 2.1 since then (renal is following). Urine lytes have
   been consistent with prerenal failure. A renal US negative though has a
   mass in his bladder which likely caused hematuria during this
   admission. He has been very sensitive to fluid boluses with
   desaturations.. His hematocrit has been stable in mid 30s. His PTT has
   been elevated to 60s, with unclear etiology.
   .
   Given his extensive CAD he was taken to cath lab on [**10-27**]  with
   revascularization of LAD with rotathrectomy and the placement of two
   cypher DES under assistance of tandem heart placement during procedure.
   Because he remained hemodynamically stable, the tandem heart was
   discontinued and his 15 French sheath was pulled. He then experienced a
   transient drop in blood pressure and was noted to have a right groin
   hematoma. He received 2 units pack red blood cells.

   This is a 75 yo M with a history of past MI, CMY with EF 15%, afib on
   coumadin, s/p pacer placement, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] today after
   being diagnosed there with RLL pna on CXR after lung exam was
   suspicious for consolidative process. Per patient's daughter, he was
   coughing for 3 weeks and was intermittently having altered mental
   status. Multiple CXR's up until today did not show any evidence of
   acute cardiopulmonary process. He was satting 87% on room air prior to
   transfer. With 3L O2 by NC, sats came up to 95%. Vitals prior to
   transfer 96.2ax 72 118/78 24.
   .
   On arrival to our ED, he was started on bipap after his DNR/DNI status
   was confirmed with patient and HCP. His [**Name2 (NI) **] were notable for a
   leukocytosis and ARF (no priors for comparison). Once Bipap was
   initiated, his sats responded well, however, he became hypotensive
   (100/50 -> 80 with starting bipap). He was given 2L NS, then levophed
   was started through peripheral line in lieu of IVF given unknown EF. He
   was also given aspirin, vanco, CTX and levofloxacin for his pneumonia.
   Blood cultures were drawn. On transfer, his pulse 70, BP 99/70, RR 20,
   satting 100% on bipap.
   EVENTS:  No BiPap overnight---no acute change in resp status,
   hemodynamically stable off of vasopressors, Tolerating Lasix gtt  for
   gently diuresis
   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 73**])
   Assessment:
   Lungs clear bilat upper lobes and with rales at bilat bases,
   occasionally with mild expiratory wheezing noted, denies SOB when
   asked, regular respirations/nonlabored, RR= 15-18 with Sats=94-100%,
   strong productive cough of thick white sputum, Lasix gtt infusing at
   4mg/hr, no vasopressors, BP= 100-125/40-50
s with MAP
s >60
   Action:
   IV antibx as ordered, nebs as ordered, 02 decreased from 4L NC to 2L NC
   with good Sats, encouraged to TCDB, Lasix gtt increased from 2mg/hr to
   4 mg/hr with goal to get pt neg 500-1000ml
   Response:
   Improved resp status, diuresing with Lasix without hemodynamic
   instablility---was positive 600ml last evening and is now neg 300ml.
   Plan:
   Continue gently diuresis---neg goal is 500-1000ml,  continue antibx,
   aggressive pulmonary toileting as tolerated, if remains stable today
   then possible transfer to medical floor for further management.

   with colovesicular fistula in [**2749**] that required partial colonic
   resection and an ileostomy. In [**2750-12-5**], she had the ileostomy reversed
   and since then, she has had worsening of her diarrhea. In fact, since
   [**Month (only) **], she has been admitted to OSH 5 times for long hospital stays with
   extensive work up that has been negative so far. Most recently, she was
   admitted to OSH [**3-28**] where workup again has been negative. She has been
   getting IVF; lasix held. The family requested a transfer to [**Hospital1 17**] this

   the Xray. Because of her hypoxia from CHF and likely PNA (leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, sputum, cough), she was transferred to the MICU for
   further care.

567,58472,"Chief Complaint:  Transfer for liver transplant evaluation
   HPI:
   51 y.o. female with a past medical history of remote Hodgkin's s/p
   treatment and staging laparotomy and splenectomy as well as a history
   of PEs, at least one of which required TPA who is being transferred
   from [**State 4101**]Hospital to be evaluated for a liver transplant. On
   [**6-18**], at NEBH, patient underwent bilateral C6-7 laminoforaminotomies
   and C5-7 posterior cervical spinal instrumented fusion with left
   posterior iliac crest bone graft harvest through a separate incision
   for cervical spondylosis. She reportedly tolerated the procedure well.
   On [**6-20**], she then presented to [**Hospital3 **] with an acute change in
   mental status in the setting of hypotension with SBP in the 80s and a
   leukocytosis of 19 with 5% bands and lactate of 5.2 along with a
   positive UA and bibasilar infiltrates on CXR. Labs were also notable
   for acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3 and a troponin of 17,
   the latter of which led her to receive ASA and Plavix. She was given
   Levofloxacin empirically and then transferred to [**State 6498**]Hospital's MICU for further management of presumed sepsis. While at
   [**Location 6499**], patient was fluid resuscitated with improvement
   in her BP after 3 L of normal saline (seemingly never requiring
   pressors), received supportive care for her renal failure with
   Kayexalate and calcium for hyperkalemia. Creatinine however increased
   to 4 with decrease in UOP to less than 5 ccs/hour. Antibiotics for
   presumed sepsis were initiated with broad coverage through Zyvox and
   Aztreonam as patient has multiple antibiotic allergies. Culture data at
   the time of transfer was unrevealing. Cardiac enzymes were followed and
   trended down to 14 (troponin, but CKs not checked). A TTE was performed
   which was very limited and commented on possible enlarged RV. Chest CT
   without contrast commented on possible dissection, but follow-up MRI
   showed no dissection. Given AST of [**Numeric Identifier 6500**] and ALT of [**Numeric Identifier 6501**], INR of 2.7
   with worsening mental status, GI was consulted and was concerned for
   significant encephalopathy (grade 3). She was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for consideration of liver transplant and in the interim once accepted,
   was intubated to protect her airway.

   pain. CT showed small bowel thickening with small amt free air. He had
   elevated WBCs and mental status changes. Follow-up CT showed no more
   air but small bowel & mestanteric inflammation.  Surgeons there felt
   intervention not necessary at that time. [**11-17**] he went to ICU with sats
   down to low 90s and was stabilized on CPAP. However he again dropped
   sats and was intubated on [**11-18**]. His troponin bumped to 5.45 and BNP was
   3030, felt to be all r/t CHF exacerbation d/t severe AS with small
   bowel perforation.

   intubated over the w/e [**Date range (1) 3255**]-receiving ABX and diuresis.  On [**11-22**]

   strength (4.5mg q8,) and he  received D5W
 for hyponatremia.
   Pt was successfully extubated on [**11-23**] and PICC was placed with
   initiation of TPN.
   On [**11-24**]- pt had repeat CT which revealed a small loculated area of fluid
   vs infection so GI surgery was consulted. They felt that in order to
   proceed with GA and a lap exploration, the pt needed to undergo AVP.
   Cardiology was consulted and consented to AVP but only if pt was to
   require surgical intervention/diagnostics of abdomen and awaited
   surgical decision.
   On [**11-25**]- surgery decided to not proceed with lap exploration and
   therefore cardiology cancelled AVP for which pt was on
standby
 for
   Fri [**11-26**]. It is planned to continue to tx pt medically for his AS. He
   has remained intermittently confused and very quiet with flat affect
   since extubation by report. He denies any pain of discomfort or trouble
   breathing. Pt remains on lopressor/ lasix daily and Zosyn with stable
   VS and o2 sats on room air. His mental status remains unclear as at

   to home hospital in [**Location (un) 8258**]. Always alert and oriented and very
   pleasant at times. However, pt began to get increasingly agitated at
   around 1530 and was trying to walk out of room and taking himself off
   monitor.
   Action:
   Attempted to reorient pt and enforce need for medical tx at this time.
   Had pt talk to wife and daughter over phone wit no effect. Eventually
   given 5 mg IV haldol with no effect and then given 2 mg IV ativan.
   Response:
   After ativan pt began to get sleepy and stopped fighting staff- able to
   rest back in bed without incident and now sleeping. Hemodynamically
   stable
   Plan:
   Closely monitor keeping bed low and locked with bed alarm on. Frequent
   reorientation. Sedation as needed/tolerated. Call family if pt begins
   to try to leave AMA.

   increased dose of heparin gtt to 3270 units/hr.
   Response:
   No attempts made at weaning vent today because of hypercarbia and pt
   increase level of sedation. Tube fdgs  put back on hold because of high
   residuals aspirated from both tubes.  Pt continues to have periods of
   increased reslessness and agitation and was medicated with 5 mg ivp

   to transfer to [**Hospital1 17**].  At OSH she received aspirin, plavix,
   integrellin, heparin, nitroglycerin, morphine, and IV metoprolol with
   improvement in chest pain to [**5-16**].  Labs were significant for negative
   troponin. ST depressions were noted in V2-V4 and subtle ST elevations
   in V6 and I.  Patient notes that chest pain started to get worse in
   ambulance in transportation to [**Hospital1 17**].
   Patient was taken to Cath lab at [**Hospital1 17**] for posterior STEMI.  She notes
   that chest pain did not resolve until angioplasty was done in Cath lab.

   fibrillation on warfarin, COPD by radiograph who presents from nursing
   home with dyspnea and found to have multifocal pneumonia on chest

   wife, he was in his normal state of health the day prior, which is
   demented, unable to walk and or perform ADLs, but had eaten a full
   meal. He reportedly has had problems with swallowing his foods and has
   been noted to cough after eating and drinking. To the best of the
   wife's knowledge, he has not had any sick contacts. Today, he was noted
   to have a dyspnea and a low-grade fever and was thus brought in to the
   ED for further evaluation.

   lactate was elevated to 6.2. CXR showed multifocal PNA and patient was
   given vancomycin 1g, zosyn 4.5g, and 650mg tylenol along with 1 liter
   normal saline. After discussion with patient's wife and HCP, it was
   clarified that patient is DNR/DNI. Additionally, the patient's wife
   expressed a desire to have no central access or pressors. Given his
   dyspnea and tachypnea, BiPAP was started and the patient was more calm.
   He was admitted to the ICU for further management.
   .
   On the floor, patient appeared comfortable and denied pain. He was able
   to follow commands. The patient's wife and son were engaged in a
   lengthy conversation during which the wife revealed that she is
   confident that the patient would not want anything to prolong his life
   given his current mental status and quality of life. She and her son
   expressed a goal of keeping him comfortable with BiPAP since it had
   been started and morphine if necessary for air hunger. The wife
   eventually expressed an interest in discontinuing antibiotics since she
   felt that they were counterproductive in the goal of not prolonging his
   life. It was also decided to hold IVF.

1247,94665,"Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2825**] is a 52yo woman h/o COPD, breast cancer who presented to an
   OSH for evaluation of shortness of breath. She notes she has not been
   feeling well for several weeks when she noted pain in her back.
   Initially she was diagnosed with a muscle spasm and given pain
   mediation. When the pain did not subside she returned for further care
   and it was noted that she had a rash that appeared to be consistant
   with shingles. She describes the pain as a band from her abdomen to her
   back. She was treated with a course of valtrex which she completed and
   the rash resolved. Her pain persisted, despite treatment with oxycodone
   and vicodin. Over the last several days, the patient noted a sore
   throat and increasing oxygen requirement (she typically is on 2L O2 NC
   at home). She also noted fevers to 102 at home and decreasing O2 sats
   from 90s to 79% with ambulation. This past weekend (during storm) the
   patient was exceedingly anxious after the electricity went out. She was
   trying to find her oxygen tank and felt herself coughing so hard she
   could barely catch her breath.
   She denies having any chest pains or dizziness, N/V. She went to an OSH
   for shortness of breath and back pain. On CXR she found to have
   multifocal PNA, also notable on labs were a leukocytosis to 24, d-dimer
   1.2 (elevated). A CTA was performed however there was dye leak into the
   left hand and the test was aborted. She was given ceftriaxone and
   transfered to [**Hospital1 1**].
   On arrival, she was noted to be afebrile with BPs in 120/60s, HR 105,
   breathing in 20s, O2 sats 80s on 2L. With albuterol and ipratropium
   nebs and morphine her O2 sat was 90s on 4L and much more comfortable.
   Noted on exam were a tense compartment in L hand. Plastics was called
   to evaluate and recommended elevatation and frequent pulse checks. CT
   from the outside hospital shows multifocal PNA, however given lack of
   contrast cannot evaluate for PE. Also on CXR were 3 fractured ribs on R
   side. Notable on her labs in the ED were a leukocytosis with left
   shift, elevated bicarb. She was started on 750mg levofloxacin IV and 1L
   IVF was started prior to transfer to the MICU. On admission to ICU, she
   was afebrile with BP 130/70s, HR 103, 95% 4L O2.

   pain was a pressure, [**3-31**], exacerbated with exertion, which radiated to
   his left shoulder.  The pain resolved with rest.  The patient underwent
   an ETT last Tuesday, where he exercised 4-5 minutes before reproducing
   the same chest pain.  The pain continued for approximately 4 minutes of
   rest after the test was stopped.  He was started on Toprol XL and
   presented to [**Hospital6 1749**] today for elective cardiac
   catheterization.  During the catheterization, a 90% stenosis was found
   in the LAD, so the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] for PCI.

   During the cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 17**], the patient was found to

   there was a contrast stain worrisome for microperforation.  The patient
   had a TTE at this time which did not show any evidence of effusion.  He
