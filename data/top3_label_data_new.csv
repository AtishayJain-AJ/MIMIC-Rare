166,"Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2825**] is a 52yo woman h/o COPD, breast cancer who presented to an
   OSH for evaluation of shortness of breath. She notes she has not been
   feeling well for several weeks when she noted pain in her back.
   Initially she was diagnosed with a muscle spasm and given pain
   mediation. When the pain did not subside she returned for further care
   and it was noted that she had a rash that appeared to be consistant
   with shingles. She describes the pain as a band from her abdomen to her
   back. She was treated with a course of valtrex which she completed and
   the rash resolved. Her pain persisted, despite treatment with oxycodone
   and vicodin. Over the last several days, the patient noted a sore
   throat and increasing oxygen requirement (she typically is on 2L O2 NC
   at home). She also noted fevers to 102 at home and decreasing O2 sats
   from 90s to 79% with ambulation. This past weekend (during storm) the
   patient was exceedingly anxious after the electricity went out. She was
   trying to find her oxygen tank and felt herself coughing so hard she
   could barely catch her breath.
   She denies having any chest pains or dizziness, N/V. She went to an OSH
   for shortness of breath and back pain. On CXR she found to have
   multifocal PNA, also notable on labs were a leukocytosis to 24, d-dimer
   1.2 (elevated). A CTA was performed however there was dye leak into the
   left hand and the test was aborted. She was given ceftriaxone and
   transfered to [**Hospital1 1**].
   On arrival, she was noted to be afebrile with BPs in 120/60s, HR 105,
   breathing in 20s, O2 sats 80s on 2L. With albuterol and ipratropium
   nebs and morphine her O2 sat was 90s on 4L and much more comfortable.
   Noted on exam were a tense compartment in L hand. Plastics was called
   to evaluate and recommended elevatation and frequent pulse checks. CT
   from the outside hospital shows multifocal PNA, however given lack of
   contrast cannot evaluate for PE. Also on CXR were 3 fractured ribs on R
   side. Notable on her labs in the ED were a leukocytosis with left
   shift, elevated bicarb. She was started on 750mg levofloxacin IV and 1L
   IVF was started prior to transfer to the MICU. On admission to ICU, she
   was afebrile with BP 130/70s, HR 103, 95% 4L O2.

252,"ADMISSION NOTE
   This is a 60 M with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV ,. Presented to ED on
   [**3-21**] and was admitted  with cough, leukocytosis and hypotension.  He
   was initially complaining of overall malaiase and worsening L shoulder
   and knee pain for which he had been taking increased opiates. Of note,
   he was recently admitted from [**3-6**] to [**3-14**] with respiratory distress and
   was found to have a RML/RLL pna for which he completed a 10 day course
   of ctx/azithro. During  last admission tunnel cath was placed and pt
   was started on HD.
    In the ED he became transiently hypotensive and responded to volume.
   In the ED, he was restarted on CTX and azithro for a possible CAP, and
   Vanco and Flagyl were added for a possible biliary source of infection
   after the patient was found to also have a new transaminitis. CT
   abd/pelvis in the ED was unremarkable for source.
   .
   On the floor, abx were expanded to vanc/zosyn for HAP given
   leukocytosis, hypotension. Low grade temperature to 100.2.  He has been
   intermittently oriented on x2 with somnolence.  No ABGs had been done
   prior.  BPs stable from 94-120 systolic with HRs in the 70s-90s.  He
   was on 2-3L NC.  Stools had been guaiac negative, has had reasonable
   urine output, las HD session was [**3071-3-21**].  He had rec'd his home
   oxycontine 40 mg on the morning of [**3-21**], though further opiates were
   held due to somnolence.   He was also found to have a decreasing
   platelet count, and due to concern for HIT, he was placed on
   Argatroban, dosed for hepatic disease.
   .
   On the morning of MICU transfer, the patient was found to be more
   somnolent than prior but arousable.  ABG showed 7.24/76/94.  At that
   time, given somnolence, he was transferred to the ICU for likely BiPap
   and further management.
   .
   Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient is easily arousable and moaning
   in pain.  He is refusing BiPap, and he is not oriented or appropriate
   enough to consent or refuse intubation.  He is unable to provide his
   sister's phone number though he is making a concerted effort.  He is
   complaining of neck pain.  Unable to obtain complete ROS

   being diagnosed there with RLL pna on CXR after lung exam was
   suspicious for consolidative process. Per patient's daughter, he was
   coughing for 3 weeks and was intermittently having altered mental
   status. Multiple CXR's up until today did not show any evidence of
   acute cardiopulmonary process. He was satting 87% on room air prior to

   On arrival to our ED, he was started on bipap after his DNR/DNI status
   was confirmed with patient and HCP. His [**Name2 (NI) **] were notable for a
   leukocytosis and ARF (no priors for comparison). Once Bipap was
   initiated, his sats responded well, however, he became hypotensive
   (100/50 -> 80 with starting bipap). He was given 2L NS, then levophed
   was started through peripheral line in lieu of IVF given unknown EF. He
   was also given aspirin, vanco, CTX and levofloxacin for his pneumonia.
   Blood cultures were drawn. On transfer, his pulse 70, BP 99/70, RR 20,

   for further care and placement in an apartment. The day of planned

   The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of COPD (on home
   O2,) CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, AF on coumadin, vagal sinus arrest s/p PPM
   who was transferred from an OSH after presenting with shortness of
   breath.  In [**2864-1-27**] the patient underwent a closed reduction of a
   right hip dislocation, and her hospitalization was complicated by a
   report of bilateral PNA and COPD exacerbation.  She was discharged on a
   course of antibiotics and a prednisone taper.  One week following
   discharge, the patient had worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea,
   and worsening lower extremity edema.  She was initially treated for a
   recurrent COPD exacerbation, but when cardiac markers cycled back as
   positive, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] on [**2864-2-19**] for cardiac
   catheterization.
   .
   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed diffuse
   obstructing LAD disease, and 4 [**Name [** Location **] ([** Location **]es) **] [**Last Name ([** Location **]es) **] were placed.  An
   echocardiogram after the event showed regional wall motion
   abnormalities with an EF of 40%.  The patient required ICU admission
   following catheterization due to hypoxia.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure was believed due to heart failure, as well as a
   COPD exacerbation.  With increased sputum production and wheezing, the
   patient was treated with antibiotics and a prednisone taper.
   .
   During the hospitalization she had a 20 second asystolic episode,
   likely secondary to vagal episode.  Code blue was called but patient
   quickly recovered blood pressure, heart rate and respirations without
   intervention.  Review of telemetry appeared to have sinus bradycardia
   and slowing before 20sec pause then sinus tachycardia with recovering
   of pulse. A PPM was placed.
   .
   The patient has done well in subsequent follow up.  She may have had a
   recent hospitalization from God Samaritan Medical Center with a recent
   CHF exacerbation.  Per report, she had complaints of 2 days of
   shortness of breath, with sudden worsening the day of presentation.
   Notes say that her symptoms worse with laying flat  The patient actived
   EMS, and on their arrival vitals of HR 132, BP 200/80, RR 24, 88% on

   for further evaluation. While at [**Hospital3 719**], her O2 sats were
   reported at 100%.  She became apneic and unresponsive.  After a

   HPI:
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with a PMH of afib who presents from home after a fall.
   History is obtained from patient's wife as patient is intubated.  Per
   the patient's wife he was in his USOH today, eating a meal when he got
   up from the table.  He usually walks with a walker, however he was not
   using it at the time.  She heard a thud and turned and found her
   husband on the floor.  She does not think that he lost consciousness.
   There was no witnessed seizure activity.  He was not complaining of
   chest pain, SOB, palpitations, abdominal pain or nausea prior to the
   fall. Per the patient's wife he has not been recently ill.  EMS was
   called and he was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 76**].  At the OSH he was found to
   have slowed speech and confusion.  He complained of right hip pain.  A
   head CT was attempted and in the scanner the patient had witnessed
   vomiting, aspiration and respiratory arrest.  He was intubated.  CXR
   showed bilateral infiltrates and he was given levo/flagyl and vanco.
   He also received morphine 2mg, etomodate, versed 1mg x3 and 3L IVF.
   Head CT was then obtained and was reportedly negative.  He was then
   transferred here for further care.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals: T 98.4  HR 63  BP 107/47
   RR 28.  He continued to be unresponsive despite no further sedating
   medications.  Due to concern for stroke he was evaluated by neurology
   who felt that a primary neurologic event was less likely and concern
   for hypoxic injury was raised.  Hip films were negative for fracture.
   He was placed in c-collar for narrowing in his c-spine, however there
   was no fracture.  He was given 1L IVF and admitted to the MICU for
   further management.

   fatigue. Also reported fever up to 101.8.  He also felt a little bit
   more short of breath than usual.  He had a + sick contact a week prior
   who had cough and fevers.  At that visit a CXR and flu swab were done
   and were negative.  Per his wife he continued to feel more poorly at

   HPI:
   51 y.o. female with a past medical history of remote Hodgkin's s/p
   treatment and staging laparotomy and splenectomy as well as a history
   of PEs, at least one of which required TPA who is being transferred
   from [**State 4101**]Hospital to be evaluated for a liver transplant. On
   [**6-18**], at NEBH, patient underwent bilateral C6-7 laminoforaminotomies
   and C5-7 posterior cervical spinal instrumented fusion with left
   posterior iliac crest bone graft harvest through a separate incision
   for cervical spondylosis. She reportedly tolerated the procedure well.
   On [**6-20**], she then presented to [**Hospital3 **] with an acute change in
   mental status in the setting of hypotension with SBP in the 80s and a
   leukocytosis of 19 with 5% bands and lactate of 5.2 along with a
   positive UA and bibasilar infiltrates on CXR. Labs were also notable
   for acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3 and a troponin of 17,
   the latter of which led her to receive ASA and Plavix. She was given
   Levofloxacin empirically and then transferred to [**State 6498**]Hospital's MICU for further management of presumed sepsis. While at
   [**Location 6499**], patient was fluid resuscitated with improvement
   in her BP after 3 L of normal saline (seemingly never requiring
   pressors), received supportive care for her renal failure with
   Kayexalate and calcium for hyperkalemia. Creatinine however increased
   to 4 with decrease in UOP to less than 5 ccs/hour. Antibiotics for
   presumed sepsis were initiated with broad coverage through Zyvox and
   Aztreonam as patient has multiple antibiotic allergies. Culture data at
   the time of transfer was unrevealing. Cardiac enzymes were followed and
   trended down to 14 (troponin, but CKs not checked). A TTE was performed
   which was very limited and commented on possible enlarged RV. Chest CT
   without contrast commented on possible dissection, but follow-up MRI
   showed no dissection. Given AST of [**Numeric Identifier 6500**] and ALT of [**Numeric Identifier 6501**], INR of 2.7
   with worsening mental status, GI was consulted and was concerned for
   significant encephalopathy (grade 3). She was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for consideration of liver transplant and in the interim once accepted,
   was intubated to protect her airway.

   insufficiency (baseline creat 1.5), CHF, HTN, anemia, dementia,  and
   aortic stenosis and insufficiency who presents with hypotension.  She
   has had a poor PO intake and had not been doing well for the last
   several months. She was noted to be hiding her medications under her
   pillow, very constipated, refusing to eat or drink or get out of bed.
   Her daughter reports that worsening constipation and mental status over
   the last few days was what prompted the ED visit. Her daughter reports
   that recently the patient has needed to be spoon-fed medications.
   .
   She was transferred here from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**], where she was hypotensive
   with a BP of 68/48 right arm, 110/70 left, heart rate 79, respiratory
   rate 33 and temperature  of 94.2 rectally. At [**Location (un) 3**], she was noted to
   have a lactate of 6.4. A left femoral line was placed. She was given
   two liters of normal saline and started on dopamine, however she became
   tachycardic so was switched to levophed. She was given 1 gram of
   vancomycin and 1 gram of ceftriaxone.  She was given 300 mg aspirin for
   an elevated troponin of 0.806 (0.6 in 6/[**3116**]).

   residing in a nursing home  found unresponsive in vomitus and asystolic
   this morning, apenic and cyanotic, he had made some gasping efforts.
   He was seen 10 minutes earlier and in no distress and at baseline.
   Apparently nursing staff noted him to be apenic and placed an AED which
   advised ""no shock"" and called EMS.  By EMS he was noted to be in a PEA
   arrest with a narrow complex tachycardia at a rate of around 100.  He
   was given epi and atropine x 2 doses each.  He never regained a pulse
   during his transport.  By the time he arrived at [**Hospital3 **] he was
   again noted to be in PEA arrest with a rate of 170-180 with occasional
   triplets of PVCs.  He was given 1mg of epi, 1 amp of bicarb and 1g of
   magnesium (for the ectopy) and he regained a pulse with a SBP of 100.
   His perfusing rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 with
   reportedly no ischemic changes on his EKG.
   .
   The patient had been intubated in the field and in the ER there had
   been vomitus in the ET tube.  The patient was initially vented at AC
   500 x 14 with a PEEP of 5 and FiO2 of 100%.  His ABG on this was 7.1 /
   52 / 510.  At this point his FiO2 was decreased to 40%, a CXR revealed
   some scarring at the R base of the patient's lung, also the ET tube was
   at the carina and was pulled back 2 cm. In transport with [**Location (un) 1038**],
   had another arrest, diverted briefly to [**Hospital6 **], where
   pulse was regained. Total downtime on second arrest approx 30 mins.

   to [**Location (un) 3**] and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**2504-10-14**].
   .
   His chest pain was attributed to his known disease. He had already been
   on maximal medical therapy at home and this was continued during
   hospitalization. He continued to have daily chest pain consistent with
   stable disease.. He was planned to undergo catheterization today.
   During this hospitalization he was noted to be volume overloaded and
   was given furosemide for diuresis. Notably, after diuresis he developed
   worsening renal failure with cre from 1.2 to 2.9. This has been
   trending down to 2.1 since then (renal is following). Urine lytes have
   been consistent with prerenal failure. A renal US negative though has a
   mass in his bladder which likely caused hematuria during this
   admission. He has been very sensitive to fluid boluses with
   desaturations.. His hematocrit has been stable in mid 30s. His PTT has
   been elevated to 60s, with unclear etiology.

   Given his extensive CAD he was taken to cath lab on [**10-27**]  with
   revascularization of LAD with rotathrectomy and the placement of two
   cypher DES under assistance of tandem heart placement during procedure.
   Because he remained hemodynamically stable, the tandem heart was
   discontinued and his 15 French sheath was pulled. He then experienced a
   transient drop in blood pressure and was noted to have a right groin
   hematoma. He received 2 units pack red blood cells.

   mechanical AVR who was initially admitted on [**2708-12-20**] from rehab after
   recent partial colectomy for ischemic bowel for hypotension and likely
   PNA.  During his first ICU stay he was briefly on pressors and quickly
   weaned off of them. His PICC line was d/c'ed. He received 2 units of
   blood for an hct of 22 and bumped appropriately.  CT negative for
   bleeding. Diuretics were held in setting of hypotension and he received
   a small fluid bolus for bp's to the 90's and responded well.  Echo
   showed baseline EF of 25% and new moderate pulmonary artery
   hypertension.  CXR showed new RM/RLL opacity.
   He was transferred to the floor last night. His diuretics and ACEi were
   written to be restarted this morning as he was crackly on exam last
   night and more so this morning.  He didn't receive them prior to his
   decompensation.  This morning [**12-25**] at 9:30 he became acutely short of
   breath and hypoxic to 72% on a NRB from presumed flash pulmonary edema
   while on the bed pan. A code was called and patient was emergently
   intubated by anesthesia.  He received Lasix 60mg iv with 40cc of urine
   output.  Patient was stabilized on floor and was sating 100% on 500x14

   patient ambulatory prior to flight.  During the flight he was in Afib,
   satting 96-100% on 3L NC.  Never hypotensive or tachycardic. BS varied
   from 81-441 (pre/post dextrose administration).  Patient became
   confused ~1615. His rate increased to 110 ~ 1700, labeled as ? for
   which he received 100mg Lidocaine, presumably IV just prior to arrival
   at [**Hospital1 1**].  After deplaning from a medivac flight, the patient became
   unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1**] emergency room.
   In the ED, vital signs were initially: 96.9 69 180/84 12 100% NRB.
   Patient was intubated for airway protection given unresponsiveness. He
   was given Vanc/Zosyn for HAP vs. abdominal process. BS in the 70s,
   given D50 without change in mental status.  Transferred to the MICU.
   On arrival to the floor, the patient is not responsive to voice or
   sternal rub.  His family is present and confirm the hospital course.
   Per all reports, he was independent at home and still working but
   ""slowing down"" recently with weight loss, several recent
   hospitalizations for pneumonia.  His rapid change in status today was
   unexpected and not at all resembling his recent hospital course.

   admitted to the floor for PNA. Never hypotensive in their ED.  Some

   ID, Endocrine consulted with the major change being abx switced to
   Zosyn for PNA.

   with EF ~15% who presents to the ED with hypotension.  He ""thinks"" that
   he took too much off with PD at home today but cannot quantify exact
   amount. He states he usually takes off 1500ml but knows it was a lot
   higher than this number.
   .
   Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (2) 11961**] for cellulitis and
   abscess of the R thigh which was I&D'd on [**4-28**].  He was treated
   initially with Vanc/Unasyn, then changed to Unasyn when cultures came
   back with MSSA.  He was discharged on Augmentin for a further 10 day
   course to end [**2866-5-13**].

   In the ER, initial vitals were T98.6F, HR 74, BP 70/37, RR 17 and
   oxygen sat 99% RA.  Blood pressures dropped to 56 systolic and he was
   given 2L NS and systolics came up to 70s-80, so he was placed on
   peripheral dopamine.  He was given vanc/zosyn in the ED for broad
   coverage, with particular concern for cellulitis spread / abscesses in
   legs. Renal was consulted and will plan to follow patient as inpatient.
   His PD fluid was sent for culture and cytology.  Cell count from the PD
   fluid showed 50 WBCs and 9% polys.  ECG showed ST depressions
   anterolaterally which are similar to prior ECGs.  He had a central line
   placed for access to continue monitoring hemodynamics and for easy
   pressor use.
