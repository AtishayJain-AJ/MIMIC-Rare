   117/56. The pt was intubated for airway protection and started on
   pressors to support her blood pressure. Central venous access was
   obtained. CT scans of the chest and abd were obtained which
   demonstrated a large left sided PTX without evidence of tension, as
   well as air tracking down into the abd. A chest tube was placed and
   surgical consultation was requested; surgery felt the pt was not an

317,"Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2825**] is a 52yo woman h/o COPD, breast cancer who presented to an
   OSH for evaluation of shortness of breath. She notes she has not been
   feeling well for several weeks when she noted pain in her back.
   Initially she was diagnosed with a muscle spasm and given pain
   mediation. When the pain did not subside she returned for further care
   and it was noted that she had a rash that appeared to be consistant
   with shingles. She describes the pain as a band from her abdomen to her
   back. She was treated with a course of valtrex which she completed and
   the rash resolved. Her pain persisted, despite treatment with oxycodone
   and vicodin. Over the last several days, the patient noted a sore
   throat and increasing oxygen requirement (she typically is on 2L O2 NC
   at home). She also noted fevers to 102 at home and decreasing O2 sats
   from 90s to 79% with ambulation. This past weekend (during storm) the
   patient was exceedingly anxious after the electricity went out. She was
   trying to find her oxygen tank and felt herself coughing so hard she
   could barely catch her breath.
   She denies having any chest pains or dizziness, N/V. She went to an OSH
   for shortness of breath and back pain. On CXR she found to have
   multifocal PNA, also notable on labs were a leukocytosis to 24, d-dimer
   1.2 (elevated). A CTA was performed however there was dye leak into the
   left hand and the test was aborted. She was given ceftriaxone and
   transfered to [**Hospital1 1**].
   On arrival, she was noted to be afebrile with BPs in 120/60s, HR 105,
   breathing in 20s, O2 sats 80s on 2L. With albuterol and ipratropium
   nebs and morphine her O2 sat was 90s on 4L and much more comfortable.
   Noted on exam were a tense compartment in L hand. Plastics was called
   to evaluate and recommended elevatation and frequent pulse checks. CT
   from the outside hospital shows multifocal PNA, however given lack of
   contrast cannot evaluate for PE. Also on CXR were 3 fractured ribs on R
   side. Notable on her labs in the ED were a leukocytosis with left
   shift, elevated bicarb. She was started on 750mg levofloxacin IV and 1L
   IVF was started prior to transfer to the MICU. On admission to ICU, she
   was afebrile with BP 130/70s, HR 103, 95% 4L O2.

489,"ADMISSION NOTE
   This is a 60 M with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV ,. Presented to ED on
   [**3-21**] and was admitted  with cough, leukocytosis and hypotension.  He
   was initially complaining of overall malaiase and worsening L shoulder
   and knee pain for which he had been taking increased opiates. Of note,
   he was recently admitted from [**3-6**] to [**3-14**] with respiratory distress and
   was found to have a RML/RLL pna for which he completed a 10 day course
   of ctx/azithro. During  last admission tunnel cath was placed and pt
   was started on HD.
    In the ED he became transiently hypotensive and responded to volume.
   In the ED, he was restarted on CTX and azithro for a possible CAP, and
   Vanco and Flagyl were added for a possible biliary source of infection
   after the patient was found to also have a new transaminitis. CT
   abd/pelvis in the ED was unremarkable for source.
   .
   On the floor, abx were expanded to vanc/zosyn for HAP given
   leukocytosis, hypotension. Low grade temperature to 100.2.  He has been
   intermittently oriented on x2 with somnolence.  No ABGs had been done
   prior.  BPs stable from 94-120 systolic with HRs in the 70s-90s.  He
   was on 2-3L NC.  Stools had been guaiac negative, has had reasonable
   urine output, las HD session was [**3071-3-21**].  He had rec'd his home
   oxycontine 40 mg on the morning of [**3-21**], though further opiates were
   held due to somnolence.   He was also found to have a decreasing
   platelet count, and due to concern for HIT, he was placed on
   Argatroban, dosed for hepatic disease.
   .
   On the morning of MICU transfer, the patient was found to be more
   somnolent than prior but arousable.  ABG showed 7.24/76/94.  At that
   time, given somnolence, he was transferred to the ICU for likely BiPap
   and further management.
   .
   Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient is easily arousable and moaning
   in pain.  He is refusing BiPap, and he is not oriented or appropriate
   enough to consent or refuse intubation.  He is unable to provide his
   sister's phone number though he is making a concerted effort.  He is
   complaining of neck pain.  Unable to obtain complete ROS

   being diagnosed there with RLL pna on CXR after lung exam was
   suspicious for consolidative process. Per patient's daughter, he was
   coughing for 3 weeks and was intermittently having altered mental
   status. Multiple CXR's up until today did not show any evidence of
   acute cardiopulmonary process. He was satting 87% on room air prior to

   On arrival to our ED, he was started on bipap after his DNR/DNI status
   was confirmed with patient and HCP. His [**Name2 (NI) **] were notable for a
   leukocytosis and ARF (no priors for comparison). Once Bipap was
   initiated, his sats responded well, however, he became hypotensive
   (100/50 -> 80 with starting bipap). He was given 2L NS, then levophed
   was started through peripheral line in lieu of IVF given unknown EF. He
   was also given aspirin, vanco, CTX and levofloxacin for his pneumonia.

   The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of COPD (on home
   O2,) CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, AF on coumadin, vagal sinus arrest s/p PPM
   who was transferred from an OSH after presenting with shortness of
   breath.  In [**2864-1-27**] the patient underwent a closed reduction of a
   right hip dislocation, and her hospitalization was complicated by a
   report of bilateral PNA and COPD exacerbation.  She was discharged on a
   course of antibiotics and a prednisone taper.  One week following
   discharge, the patient had worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea,
   and worsening lower extremity edema.  She was initially treated for a
   recurrent COPD exacerbation, but when cardiac markers cycled back as
   positive, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] on [**2864-2-19**] for cardiac
   catheterization.
   .
   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed diffuse
   obstructing LAD disease, and 4 [**Name [** Location **] ([** Location **]es) **] [**Last Name ([** Location **]es) **] were placed.  An
   echocardiogram after the event showed regional wall motion
   abnormalities with an EF of 40%.  The patient required ICU admission
   following catheterization due to hypoxia.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure was believed due to heart failure, as well as a
   COPD exacerbation.  With increased sputum production and wheezing, the
   patient was treated with antibiotics and a prednisone taper.
   .
   During the hospitalization she had a 20 second asystolic episode,
   likely secondary to vagal episode.  Code blue was called but patient
   quickly recovered blood pressure, heart rate and respirations without
   intervention.  Review of telemetry appeared to have sinus bradycardia
   and slowing before 20sec pause then sinus tachycardia with recovering
   of pulse. A PPM was placed.
   .
   The patient has done well in subsequent follow up.  She may have had a
   recent hospitalization from God Samaritan Medical Center with a recent
   CHF exacerbation.  Per report, she had complaints of 2 days of
   shortness of breath, with sudden worsening the day of presentation.
   Notes say that her symptoms worse with laying flat  The patient actived
   EMS, and on their arrival vitals of HR 132, BP 200/80, RR 24, 88% on
   unknown oxygen.  She was described as having pursed lips, audible
   wheezes, and respiratory distress.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 719**]
   for further evaluation. While at [**Hospital3 719**], her O2 sats were
   reported at 100%.  She became apneic and unresponsive.  After a
   difficult intubation, she was successfully intubated, and transferred
   to [**Hospital1 17**] for further evaluation.

   the patient's wife he was in his USOH today, eating a meal when he got
   up from the table.  He usually walks with a walker, however he was not
   using it at the time.  She heard a thud and turned and found her
   husband on the floor.  She does not think that he lost consciousness.
   There was no witnessed seizure activity.  He was not complaining of
   chest pain, SOB, palpitations, abdominal pain or nausea prior to the
   fall. Per the patient's wife he has not been recently ill.  EMS was
   called and he was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 76**].  At the OSH he was found to
   have slowed speech and confusion.  He complained of right hip pain.  A
   head CT was attempted and in the scanner the patient had witnessed
   vomiting, aspiration and respiratory arrest.  He was intubated.  CXR
   showed bilateral infiltrates and he was given levo/flagyl and vanco.
   He also received morphine 2mg, etomodate, versed 1mg x3 and 3L IVF.
   Head CT was then obtained and was reportedly negative.  He was then
   transferred here for further care.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals: T 98.4  HR 63  BP 107/47
   RR 28.  He continued to be unresponsive despite no further sedating
   medications.  Due to concern for stroke he was evaluated by neurology
   who felt that a primary neurologic event was less likely and concern
   for hypoxic injury was raised.  Hip films were negative for fracture.
   He was placed in c-collar for narrowing in his c-spine, however there
   was no fracture.  He was given 1L IVF and admitted to the MICU for
   further management.

   Levofloxacin empirically and then transferred to [**State 6498**]Hospital's MICU for further management of presumed sepsis. While at
   [**Location 6499**], patient was fluid resuscitated with improvement
   in her BP after 3 L of normal saline (seemingly never requiring
   pressors), received supportive care for her renal failure with
   Kayexalate and calcium for hyperkalemia. Creatinine however increased
   to 4 with decrease in UOP to less than 5 ccs/hour. Antibiotics for
   presumed sepsis were initiated with broad coverage through Zyvox and
   Aztreonam as patient has multiple antibiotic allergies. Culture data at
   the time of transfer was unrevealing. Cardiac enzymes were followed and
   trended down to 14 (troponin, but CKs not checked). A TTE was performed
   which was very limited and commented on possible enlarged RV. Chest CT
   without contrast commented on possible dissection, but follow-up MRI
   showed no dissection. Given AST of [**Numeric Identifier 6500**] and ALT of [**Numeric Identifier 6501**], INR of 2.7
   with worsening mental status, GI was consulted and was concerned for
   significant encephalopathy (grade 3). She was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for consideration of liver transplant and in the interim once accepted,
   was intubated to protect her airway.

   Please see initial H&P from [**5-21**] BMT service for additional oncology
   details. In summary, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 62**] is a 69-year-old spanish speaking male
   with multiple myeloma, ESRD on HD, history of right PICA CVA, and
   hypertension who was initially admitted for altered mental status and
   hypercalcemia. He is now being transferred for additional pain control
   and hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of extreme pain in his lower
   back region and some recent desaturations to high 80s level which have
   been attributed to hypoventilation from pain medications, and his
   recent PE and PNA.  Per BMT service, the patient's hypercalcemia was
   reversed primarily through combination of dialysis, steroids and
   calcitonin. Last calcium level is in the 9 range. Although he had
   slight improvement mental status he continues to be very senstive to
   any BZDs and he has intermittent confusion from pain related delerium.
   While on BMT service he was found to have a RUL PNA and was put on
   precautions for Tb vs. fungal infection.  He was also started on
   Vanc/Zosyn for HAP. He was given a 10 day course of Abx from [**Date range (1) 8406**]
   but then  spiked a fever on [**5-31**] and was then switched to  Linezolid
   and Micafungin per ID recommendations. Now antifungal has been switched
   to Voriconazole.  He had a bronchoscopy and an induced sputum both
   negative for AFB and fungal etiology. Most recent CTA done [**5-31**] picked
   up a small PE in LLL so he has been on weight based heparin drip. Also
   had a prior PE in [**7-9**].
   .
   Since admission he has developed worsened  back, hip, and leg pain that
   was controlled with oxycontin IR 5mg  q4hrs and APAP.  Pain control has
   been increasingly difficult and his pain regimen was expanded to
   include IV morphine 1-4mg q6hrs PRN, MS Contin 30mg [**Hospital1 7**]-->now 15mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   and Oxycontin IR 5mg q4hrs PRN, along with varied doses of Dilauded and
   Decadron. X-rays of the pelvis and right femur were negative for
   fracture.  He has known multiple myeloma in his lumbar vertebrae which
   was seen again on his recent CT imaging done [**5-31**] (see below x-ray
   section). Patient refusing MRI which was considered to be sure of no
   overt compressions

   was recently discharged after an extended ICU admission for
   pancreatits/hematemesis who during his hospital stay had a cardiac
   arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury. MRI showed diffuse anoxic
   injury, and CT showed loss of [**Doctor Last Name 1328**]/white matter differentiation.  He
   began having seizure activity on [**2841-5-29**] and was treated with Keppra.
   He also had an EEG that was nondiagnostic, and subsequent EEG that
   showed seizures in the occipital lobe.  Keppra was increased and
   seizures were controlled prior to d/c.  Patient had also been on valium
   for EtOH/Benzo withdrawal which was being weaned.  Just prior to d/c he
   was decreased from 5mg [**Hospital1 **] to 5mg qhs.
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6300**] was discharged to a rehab hospital where he was found to have
   what was believed to be two seizures yesterday [**7-14**] and one today with
   persistent eye deviation to the right.  He was given ativan, after
   which tremors reportedly stopped, and then transfer was arranged
   directly to the ICU.

   s/p lobectomy, COPD on 2L at baseline, type II diabetes and
   hypertension who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab with shortness of breath.
   Per notes over the past weekend she developed upper respiratory tract
   symptoms with nasal congestion, and cough productive of thick sputum.
   She was not experiencing any fevers.  She was given increased nebulizer
   treatments with some relief.  She was not experiencing chest pain or
   pleuritic type pain.  She was not experiencing nausea, vomiting,
   abdominal pain, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or
   swelling.  She does endorse some mild diarrhea.  She says that her
   breathing has been getting progressively worse over the past three days
   despite increasing nebulizer and oxygen therapy (titrated to 4L).  She
   appeared progressively worse and EMS was called for transport to
   [**Hospital1 1**].  When EMS arrived she was complaining of shortness of breath.
   Initial oxygen saturations were in the low 80s and these improved to
   94% on a non-rebreather.  She was noted to have scant wheezes in her
   upper lung fields.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch
   block, q waves in III, avF, TWF V1-V3.  She was taken to the emergency
   room.
   In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.8 P: 113 BP: 130/84 R: 25 O2 sat: 85%
   on RA.   Initial CXR showed possible infiltrate in the L upper lobe.
   EKG showed sinus tachycardia, left axis, right bundle branch block, TWI
   V1-V3, q waves III, avF, no change compared to prior earlier in the
   day.  She received vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1, zosyn 4.5 grams x 1,
   combivent nebulizers x 3, solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1.  She was placed on
   BIPAP with mild improvement.  She also received nitroglycerine for
   potential volume overload as well as lasix 20 mg IV x 1.  Her BNP was
   elevated at 1122.  Her WBC was 15.1 with 91% neutrophils.  She had one
   set of negative cardiac enzymes.  She was admitted to the intensive
   care unit for further management.
   On arrival to the ICU she reports that her shortness of breath has
   improved somewhat from this morning.  She denies fevers, chills, chest
   pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, dysuria,
   hematuria, leg pain or swelling.  Comes from rehab.  Has had recent
   rhinorrhea and productive cough without fevers.  Mild diarrhea at

811,"This is a 87 year old female with past med hx of chronic renal
   insufficiency (baseline creat 1.5), CHF, HTN, anemia, dementia,  and
   aortic stenosis and insufficiency who presents with hypotension.  She
   has had a poor PO intake and had not been doing well for the last
   several months. She was noted to be hiding her medications under her
   pillow, very constipated, refusing to eat or drink or get out of bed.
   Her daughter reports that worsening constipation and mental status over
   the last few days was what prompted the ED visit. Her daughter reports
   that recently the patient has needed to be spoon-fed medications.
   .
   She was transferred here from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**], where she was hypotensive
   with a BP of 68/48 right arm, 110/70 left, heart rate 79, respiratory
   rate 33 and temperature  of 94.2 rectally. At [**Location (un) 3**], she was noted to
   have a lactate of 6.4. A left femoral line was placed. She was given
   two liters of normal saline and started on dopamine, however she became
   tachycardic so was switched to levophed. She was given 1 gram of
   vancomycin and 1 gram of ceftriaxone.  She was given 300 mg aspirin for
   an elevated troponin of 0.806 (0.6 in 6/[**3116**]).
   Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction)
   Assessment:
   Pt has had a temp of 97 through the day without the Bair Hugger, BP has
   been stable off of the levophed.  She is a little more alert today than
   yesterday, opening her eyes spontaneously, she has some purposeful
   movements.
   Action:
   Her antibiotics were changed to IV levoflox only, IV  placed a
   peripheral line so the central line in her groin was removed.
   Response:
   Sepesis improved
   Plan:
   Transfer pt to the floor, her family has been in to visit, yesterday
   they talked to palliative care, she will not have NGT, they are working

   at this time. He is without IV access and no continuous monitoring
   device. He has been administered 5mg of IM haldol with little effect.
   He continues to be verbally abusive toward staff and non compliant with
   care being offered. Currently I am unable to have him keep the monitor
   on and thus there is no documentation of vital signs in metavision.
   The MD was informed and she did try to speak with patient re: the
   importance of being closely monitored but he is still being
   belligerent. No monitoring device on at this time.

   displaced intertrochanteric hip fracture and was transferred to [**Hospital1 17**].
   Although operative risk was high given multiple comorbidities,
   including heart disease, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, she was cleared
   pre operatively and taken for R ORIF on day of transfer. There were no
   complications during surgery.  After extubation, she required NRB and
   then was became hypotensive requiring pressors for 48 hours.  She was
   transferred to MICU and was reintubated.  She was initially treated
   with cefepime/vanc/(levaquin) in addition to IV flagyl and po vanc for

   diagnosed mediastinal mass and has been suffering from one month of
   dyspnea, cough and progressive dysphagia to solids and eventually
   liquids. He had an outpatient workup including EGD on [**3034-11-3**] which
   showed a 20mm esophageal ulcer and gastritis. Biopsy of the ulcer was
   negative for cancer. GI recommended CT chest ([**3034-11-13**]), which revealed
   an 11 SI x 11 TRV x 5.6 cm AP central, posterior mediastinal mass
   impinging on the trachea and completely compressing the esophagus. On
   [**3034-11-18**], he underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, EBUS, and
   transbronchial biopsy of the mediastinal mass. Initially the pathology
   was read as inadequate tissue for diagnosis secondary to excessive
   necrotic debris but likely a small cell carcinoma. On [**3034-11-23**] he
   presented to the ED with shortness of breath, fever and hypotension and
   was admitted to the MICU for management. Initial ED VS T 102.4 HR 111
   BP 125/69 RR22 SaO2 100% RA. Was tx w/ Vanc, Levo and 3L IVF. CXR on
   admission showed that the mediastinal mass appears to have grown in
   size. Antibiotics were changed to CTX, Vanc and Azithromycin in the
   MICU. Interventional Pulmonology did a repeat flexible bronchoscopy,
   EBUS and biopsy which was non-diagnostic. Because he was dyspneic and
   unable to lie flat, he underwent rigid bronchoscopy, for which he was
   intubated. A Y-stent was placed, he had CT chest and was transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] so he could start XRT in the AM. In the meantime, pathology
   reviewed the tissue obtained on [**3034-11-18**] and decided that the histology

1005,"46yo gentleman with h/o type 2 diabetes who presented with altered
   mental status in the setting of possible pneumonia and hyperglycemia.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Feel that his presentation was
   most likely related to marked hypovolemia and dehydration in the
   setting of hyperglycemia.  Feel that had some contribution of
   hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and feel that hyperglycemia likely due
   to acute infection, likely pneumonia.  Also could consider drug
   overdose with or without suicide attempt, sepsis, serotonin syndrome,
   or seizure.   Feel that these are less likely and psychosocially,
   patient seems in a relatively stable place.  Did have positive tox
   screen for TCAs, which typically represents a toxic level of these
   meds.
   - aggressive IV fluids, following HR, Uop, thirst
 will give another
   1L NS now
   - follow Q4-6H glucose at this point, have been 150-250
   - treat possible CAP with levofloxacin (day 1 = [**11-7**])
   - treat with tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - f/u UCx, Sputum Cx, Blood Cx
   - would hold off on psychiatry consult for now given no evidence of
   active suicidal thought
   - monitor neuro exam
   - could be consistent with seizures, consider neurology consult if
   recurs or per floor team
   - f/u final head CT
   - hold sedating meds (fentanyl, temazepam, tizanidine)
 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  Markedly hyperglycemic on
   admission.  Has insulin-dependent diabetes, does not check blood sugars
   reliably at home.  Presentation likely [** Location **]itated by infection and
   noncompliance with insulin.
   - follow Q4-6H blood sugars, will give low dose lantus now as missed
   dose last night (10 units)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes; replete K+ and Phos as needed
   - aggressive IV fluids as needed
   - restart subQ insulin
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP):  Has h/o cough and
   has new infiltrate on chest xray.
   - Send sputum Cx and urine legionella
   - Cover with levofloxacin x 5 days (day 1 = [**11-7**]) as above
 ACIDOSIS, RESPIRATORY: Likely due to hypoventilation in setting of
   altered mental status.  Anion gap is 14 with a lactate of 4.7,
   suggesting he may have had a concurrent anion gap acidosis, which is
   resolving.
   - lactate recheck 1.5
   - monitor mental status
   # Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia: Likely has pseudohyponatremia;
   elevated K+ is likely due to transcellular shifts.  Have resolved
   today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes as above
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  baseline hct 38-39 and was at baseline on
   admission, now dropped 9 points but in the setting of IV fluid
   administration, likely dilutional.  Also dropped platelets.
   - check repeat Hct and platelets now, will also need check in the
   afternoon
   - will send  T&S
   - guaiac stools
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI with [**Name [** Location **] ([** Location **]es) **] [**Last Name ([** Location **]es) **] 2 to LAD in [**2652**]:
   - continue plavix, beta blocker, and statin
   - unclear if patient may be able to tolerate ASA; would address with
   PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiac enzymes negative at presentation, no need for full rule out
   # H/o Crohn's disease:  stable
   - continue prednisone 20mg daily
   - lomotil or loperamide prn
   - will add back fentanyl patch for pain
 .H/O PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, OTHER (INCLUDING SCHIZOPHRENIA, PERSONALITY
   DISORDERS): Appears relatively stable
   - continue lamictal for now
   - lexapro pending labs and clinical improvement
   - hold temazepam for now given altered mental status
   - will touch base with psychiatrist to alert  him that he
s here, need
   to confirm nortriptyline dose as an outpatient as had likely toxic
   levels of TCAs on admission and unclear how much he was taking
   # ADHD:  no need for methyl[** Location **]ate in house
   # H/o polysubstance abuse:  tox screen negative other than TCAs
   # HTN:  continue beta blocker
   # Hypoandrogenism:  restart androgel as outpatient

   residing in a nursing home  found unresponsive in vomitus and asystolic
   this morning, apenic and cyanotic, he had made some gasping efforts.
   He was seen 10 minutes earlier and in no distress and at baseline.
   Apparently nursing staff noted him to be apenic and placed an AED which
   advised ""no shock"" and called EMS.  By EMS he was noted to be in a PEA
   arrest with a narrow complex tachycardia at a rate of around 100.  He
   was given epi and atropine x 2 doses each.  He never regained a pulse
   during his transport.  By the time he arrived at [**Hospital3 **] he was
   again noted to be in PEA arrest with a rate of 170-180 with occasional
   triplets of PVCs.  He was given 1mg of epi, 1 amp of bicarb and 1g of
   magnesium (for the ectopy) and he regained a pulse with a SBP of 100.
   His perfusing rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 with
   reportedly no ischemic changes on his EKG.
   .
   The patient had been intubated in the field and in the ER there had
   been vomitus in the ET tube.  The patient was initially vented at AC
   500 x 14 with a PEEP of 5 and FiO2 of 100%.  His ABG on this was 7.1 /
   52 / 510.  At this point his FiO2 was decreased to 40%, a CXR revealed
   some scarring at the R base of the patient's lung, also the ET tube was
   at the carina and was pulled back 2 cm. In transport with [**Location (un) 1038**],
   had another arrest, diverted briefly to [**Hospital6 **], where
   pulse was regained. Total downtime on second arrest approx 30 mins.

   intervention was made at the time, since patient declined CABG.  He was
   admitted on [**10-14**] for worsening chest pain. He was initially presented
   to [**Location (un) 3**] and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**2504-10-14**].
   .
   His chest pain was attributed to his known disease. He had already been
   on maximal medical therapy at home and this was continued during
   hospitalization. He continued to have daily chest pain consistent with
   stable disease.. He was planned to undergo catheterization today.
   During this hospitalization he was noted to be volume overloaded and
   was given furosemide for diuresis. Notably, after diuresis he developed
   worsening renal failure with cre from 1.2 to 2.9. This has been
   trending down to 2.1 since then (renal is following). Urine lytes have
   been consistent with prerenal failure. A renal US negative though has a
   mass in his bladder which likely caused hematuria during this
   admission. He has been very sensitive to fluid boluses with
   desaturations.. His hematocrit has been stable in mid 30s. His PTT has
   been elevated to 60s, with unclear etiology.
   .
   Given his extensive CAD he was taken to cath lab on [**10-27**]  with
   revascularization of LAD with rotathrectomy and the placement of two
   cypher DES under assistance of tandem heart placement during procedure.
   Because he remained hemodynamically stable, the tandem heart was
   discontinued and his 15 French sheath was pulled. He then experienced a
   transient drop in blood pressure and was noted to have a right groin
   hematoma. He received 2 units pack red blood cells.

   Briefly, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10015**] is a 67 yo M with PMH of sCHF EF 20%, HTN,
   mechanical AVR who was initially admitted on [**2708-12-20**] from rehab after
   recent partial colectomy for ischemic bowel for hypotension and likely
   PNA.  During his first ICU stay he was briefly on pressors and quickly
   weaned off of them. His PICC line was d/c'ed. He received 2 units of
   blood for an hct of 22 and bumped appropriately.  CT negative for
   bleeding. Diuretics were held in setting of hypotension and he received
   a small fluid bolus for bp's to the 90's and responded well.  Echo
   showed baseline EF of 25% and new moderate pulmonary artery
   hypertension.  CXR showed new RM/RLL opacity.
   He was transferred to the floor last night. His diuretics and ACEi were
   written to be restarted this morning as he was crackly on exam last
   night and more so this morning.  He didn't receive them prior to his
   decompensation.  This morning [**12-25**] at 9:30 he became acutely short of
   breath and hypoxic to 72% on a NRB from presumed flash pulmonary edema
   while on the bed pan. A code was called and patient was emergently
   intubated by anesthesia.  He received Lasix 60mg iv with 40cc of urine
   output.  Patient was stabilized on floor and was sating 100% on 500x14
   100%FiO2 and 10 of PEEP prior to transfer to the ICU.

   with low grade temps, dyspnea, hypoxia and concern for pneumonia.
   Patient was referred to ED earlier today from her nursing home because
   the patient had a cough and low grade temps.  The patient has severe
   dementia and is not able to provide a further history.
   In the ED, initial VS: 97.0, 71, 197/97, 22, 97% NRB.  Her vitals prior
   to transfer were 94, 151/85, 33, 94%CPAP.  She had a CXR in the ER that
   was not very remarkable.  She then subsequently had a CTA which did not
   show e/o PE, but did show likely LLL pneumonia.  She was given
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole in the ED. Her
   O2 sats on NRB drifted down to high 80s/low 90s and she was therefore
   placed on CPAP with FiO2 100%.
   Currently, she would like to go home.  She was taken off of CPAP on
   arrival, and she is satting 100% on 3L.  She cannot provide any further
   history.  She states that she's had a cough for 5 days, but her history

   patient ambulatory prior to flight.  During the flight he was in Afib,
   satting 96-100% on 3L NC.  Never hypotensive or tachycardic. BS varied
   from 81-441 (pre/post dextrose administration).  Patient became
   confused ~1615. His rate increased to 110 ~ 1700, labeled as ? for
   which he received 100mg Lidocaine, presumably IV just prior to arrival
   at [**Hospital1 1**].  After deplaning from a medivac flight, the patient became
   unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1**] emergency room.
   In the ED, vital signs were initially: 96.9 69 180/84 12 100% NRB.

   found down in her home. Evaluation in the ED showed a RML pneumonia and
   a new oxygen requirement of approximately 4 L. She was admitted to the
   floor when the day after admission she developed atrial fibrillation
   with RVR. Initially rate controlled was attempted with with IV
   metoprolol followed by IV diltiazem.  After about 18 hours, she
   converted to NSR. At this time plan was to titrate up home metoprolol
   and start po diltiazem. However, her cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
   recommended discontinuing the diltiazem and up titrating the metoprolol
   to simplify her regimen. The diltiazem was then discontinued on

   became increasingly hypoxic requiring 50% face mask (ABG

   chronic kidney disease (BL Cr 1.8), and recent hospitalization at OSH
   for infected gouty arthritis who was admitted from rehab on [**3219-5-13**]
   with scrotal cellulitis to OSH, transferred here for hemoptysis, SOB,
   chest pain, and EKG wtih ST depressions in lateral leads.  Overnight,
   he experienced further hemoptysis with acute onset of SOB, tachypnea,
   and was transferred to the MICU.
   Patient was first admitted to [**Hospital3 5151**] Hospital on [**3219-4-20**]
   with right lower extremity infected gouty arthritis and hemoptysis in
   the setting of an INR of 9.  The 1st right MP joint was aspirated and a
   right foot xray and MRI were negative for osteomyelitis. He ultimatedly
   treated wtih prednisone taper for gout in addition to IV Vancomycin for
   presumed MRSA infection. His INR was reversed with vitamin K.  AFB was
   negative.  Pulmonary felt the hemoptysis was secondary to pneumonia.
   Follow-up CXR showed a resolving RLL infiltrate.  He was discharged to
   rehab on [**3219-5-7**] on a 7 day course of Keflex with diagnoses of UTI and
   right foot super infected MSSA gouty arthritis (uric acid level 8.4).
   On [**5-11**], he was readmitted from rehab to OSH with scrotal cellulitis.
   He was started on 3g [**Hospital1 **] Unasyn with improvement.  Then on [**3219-5-12**], he
   started to experience hemoptysis, SOB, and chest pain. An EKG showed ST
   depressions in the lateral leads and troponins were trending up: 0.11
   --> 0.18.  An echo done on [**3219-5-12**] at the OSH showed LVEF 35-40% (BL
   55%) and global LV hypo kinesis.  He also went into pulmonary edema,
   received 80 mg IV Lasix.  At [**Hospital1 5**], he continued to have hemoptysis
   multiple times per day.  He was initially on a heparin gtt for NSTEMI
   and new finding of L posterior tibia vein thrombosus.  CTA showed ""1.
   No pulmonary embolism. 2. Extensive pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.
   No obvious bleeding site with the exception of possible incipient
   broncholiths in the right hilus.  Pulmonary was consulted, felt the
   ddx-included pneumonia, AVN, malignancy, pHTN/MR/CHF.  Per OSH records,
   anti-GBM was negative.  Bronchoscopy was planned.   On [**5-15**], he
   triggered for non-massive hemoptysis, desaturations to 88%, and
   respiratory distress.  His symptoms were relieved with morphine and
   Lasix.   Vanc was added for GPCs noted in sputum.  Due to this episode,
   bronchscopy was deferred.  An IVC filter was placed.  He received 1
   unit PRBcs, though HCTs have been stable at 24-25. On [**5-18**], he had
   another episode of non-massive hemoptysis, tachypnea, and tachycardia.
   He was transferred to the MICU.

   have an elevated JVP but just stable effusion on CXR, no evidence pulm
   edema. Outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4480**], decided he would benefit
   from aortic valvuloplasty since patient refuses to get aortic valve
   replacement. Ruled out for MI, chest pain was pleuritic occuring only
   with cough. He underwent valvuloplasty,  but then when arterial sheaths
   were pulled  and Angiosealed, he had a vagal episode with a SBP of
   ~50-60 and initially did not respond to atropine. Was stared on
   Dopamine and unable to wean off in cath lab, Arterial and venous
   sheaths were re introduced. He was  lethargic ( had received low dose

1238,"Mr. [**Known patient lastname 824**] is a 74yo gentleman well known to the CCU team following an
   admission [**Date range (1) 14088**], at which time he was diagnosed with amyloid
   involving his heart and kidney.  He is now presenting with acute on
   chronic renal failure, hypotension, and volume overload.
   His recent admission was notable for ongoing difficulties with
   hypotension in the setting of significant volume overload.  Work-up
   demonstrated evidence of an infiltrative process in his heart, and fat
   pad biopsy was consistent with amyloid.  He also underwent heart
   catheterization, which demonstrated inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance, and he was felt to have autonomic dysfunction
   resulting in inappropriate vasodilation.  In addition, he was seen by
   Hem/Onc, who were concerned that he likely has a plasma cell dyscrasia
   given the monoclonal spike on his SPEP.  They recommended that he be
   seen as an outpatient for possible bone marrow biopsy.
   He remained hypotensive since admission, but has also become
   progressively more anasarcic. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 17**] EW. In EW his
   bp was 71.41 and he was asymptomatic. His breath sound were dimished

1248,"Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10499**] is a 54yo M w/hx ESRD with failed tx on PD, DM-I, CAD, CHF
   with EF ~15% who presents to the ED with hypotension.  He ""thinks"" that
   he took too much off with PD at home today but cannot quantify exact
   amount. He states he usually takes off 1500ml but knows it was a lot
   higher than this number.
   .
   Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (2) 11961**] for cellulitis and
   abscess of the R thigh which was I&D'd on [**4-28**].  He was treated
   initially with Vanc/Unasyn, then changed to Unasyn when cultures came
   back with MSSA.  He was discharged on Augmentin for a further 10 day
   course to end [**2866-5-13**].
   .
   In the ER, initial vitals were T98.6F, HR 74, BP 70/37, RR 17 and
   oxygen sat 99% RA.  Blood pressures dropped to 56 systolic and he was
   given 2L NS and systolics came up to 70s-80, so he was placed on
   peripheral dopamine.  He was given vanc/zosyn in the ED for broad
   coverage, with particular concern for cellulitis spread / abscesses in
   legs. Renal was consulted and will plan to follow patient as inpatient.
   His PD fluid was sent for culture and cytology.  Cell count from the PD
   fluid showed 50 WBCs and 9% polys.  ECG showed ST depressions
   anterolaterally which are similar to prior ECGs.  He had a central line
   placed for access to continue monitoring hemodynamics and for easy
   pressor use.
   .
   On evaluation in the MICU, patient was very lethargic and attention
   waxed and waned during exam. He seemed to be in no acute distress or
   pain. Arrived with right IJ in place and was on dopamine pressor with
   blood pressures stable at 118/67.
   .
   Hypotension (not Shock)
   Assessment:
   Arrived with BP >110 on 5mcg/kg/min of dopa.  Baseline bp is 90-110.
   Possible etiologies are recent infection and possible to much fluid
   removal with PD exchange at home.  BC x 2 and PD fluid sent from ED
