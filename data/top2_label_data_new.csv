   and abdominal pain. The pt. initially presented in [**2703**] with bright red
   blood per rectum, abdominal pain, and weight loss, which led to an
   emergent colon resection in [**State 488**] for an obstructing mass with
   ulceration within the colon.  This mass revealed moderately
   differentiated adenocarcinoma .  A staging CT scan at that time was
   negative for metastasis.  He had a CEA of 1.3 back in [**2703**] and then
   underwent adjuvant 5-FU with leucovorin beginning in [**2704-3-29**] through
   [**2704-8-29**].  He completed 6 cycles of this chemotherapy.  Mr.
   [**Known patient lastname 1223**] had a surveillance colonoscopy on [**2705-1-11**], which revealed more
   than 10 mixed non-bleeding polyps throughout his entire colon.  These
   were found to be adenomas by pathology and he subsequently underwent
   subtotal colectomy on [**2705-6-13**]. He underwent surgery on [**2709-5-11**]
   and had an extended right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy and
   extensive lysis of adhesions.  The specimen within the liver revealed
   metastatic, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with
   colon primary.  Started chemotherapy [**9-6**] with Xeloda and Oxaliplatin.

142,"Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2825**] is a 52yo woman h/o COPD, breast cancer who presented to an
   OSH for evaluation of shortness of breath. She notes she has not been
   feeling well for several weeks when she noted pain in her back.
   Initially she was diagnosed with a muscle spasm and given pain
   mediation. When the pain did not subside she returned for further care
   and it was noted that she had a rash that appeared to be consistant
   with shingles. She describes the pain as a band from her abdomen to her
   back. She was treated with a course of valtrex which she completed and
   the rash resolved. Her pain persisted, despite treatment with oxycodone
   and vicodin. Over the last several days, the patient noted a sore
   throat and increasing oxygen requirement (she typically is on 2L O2 NC
   at home). She also noted fevers to 102 at home and decreasing O2 sats
   from 90s to 79% with ambulation. This past weekend (during storm) the
   patient was exceedingly anxious after the electricity went out. She was
   trying to find her oxygen tank and felt herself coughing so hard she
   could barely catch her breath.
   She denies having any chest pains or dizziness, N/V. She went to an OSH
   for shortness of breath and back pain. On CXR she found to have
   multifocal PNA, also notable on labs were a leukocytosis to 24, d-dimer
   1.2 (elevated). A CTA was performed however there was dye leak into the
   left hand and the test was aborted. She was given ceftriaxone and
   transfered to [**Hospital1 1**].
   On arrival, she was noted to be afebrile with BPs in 120/60s, HR 105,
   breathing in 20s, O2 sats 80s on 2L. With albuterol and ipratropium
   nebs and morphine her O2 sat was 90s on 4L and much more comfortable.
   Noted on exam were a tense compartment in L hand. Plastics was called
   to evaluate and recommended elevatation and frequent pulse checks. CT
   from the outside hospital shows multifocal PNA, however given lack of
   contrast cannot evaluate for PE. Also on CXR were 3 fractured ribs on R
   side. Notable on her labs in the ED were a leukocytosis with left
   shift, elevated bicarb. She was started on 750mg levofloxacin IV and 1L
   IVF was started prior to transfer to the MICU. On admission to ICU, she
   was afebrile with BP 130/70s, HR 103, 95% 4L O2.

   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of COPD, dermatomyositis,
   diastolic CHF, HTN, who presents with altered MS, dyspnea, increased
   somnolence at her nursing home.  The staff noticed her to be somnulant,
   confused and short of breath with a non productive cough; vital signs
   then revealed an oxygen saturation in the 86% on room air--> 92% on
   2L.  She was afebrile with otherwise stable vitals.  She was started on
   a NRB with improvement in her sats to 100%.
   In the ED, her vitals were 97.8, 92, 136/60, 98% 4L. FS 181. She
   initially was 98%4L and once O2 was decreased, her mental status
   slightly improved. An ABG was done which showed a PCO2 of 84. She was
   started on bipap in the ED  without a repeat ABG. She then became more
   somnolent again, and her FiO2 was decreased in an attempt to improve
   her respiratory drive. She was treated with levofloxacin and aztreonam.
   CXR was unchanged from prior. She also had a positive UA. Blood and
   urine cultures were sent.

   [**3-21**] and was admitted  with cough, leukocytosis and hypotension.  He
   was initially complaining of overall malaiase and worsening L shoulder
   and knee pain for which he had been taking increased opiates. Of note,
   he was recently admitted from [**3-6**] to [**3-14**] with respiratory distress and
   was found to have a RML/RLL pna for which he completed a 10 day course
   of ctx/azithro. During  last admission tunnel cath was placed and pt
   was started on HD.
    In the ED he became transiently hypotensive and responded to volume.
   In the ED, he was restarted on CTX and azithro for a possible CAP, and
   Vanco and Flagyl were added for a possible biliary source of infection
   after the patient was found to also have a new transaminitis. CT
   abd/pelvis in the ED was unremarkable for source.

   The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of COPD (on home
   O2,) CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, AF on coumadin, vagal sinus arrest s/p PPM
   who was transferred from an OSH after presenting with shortness of
   breath.  In [**2864-1-27**] the patient underwent a closed reduction of a
   right hip dislocation, and her hospitalization was complicated by a
   report of bilateral PNA and COPD exacerbation.  She was discharged on a
   course of antibiotics and a prednisone taper.  One week following
   discharge, the patient had worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea,
   and worsening lower extremity edema.  She was initially treated for a
   recurrent COPD exacerbation, but when cardiac markers cycled back as
   positive, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] on [**2864-2-19**] for cardiac
   catheterization.
   .
   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed diffuse
   obstructing LAD disease, and 4 [**Name [** Location **] ([** Location **]es) **] [**Last Name ([** Location **]es) **] were placed.  An
   echocardiogram after the event showed regional wall motion
   abnormalities with an EF of 40%.  The patient required ICU admission
   following catheterization due to hypoxia.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure was believed due to heart failure, as well as a
   COPD exacerbation.  With increased sputum production and wheezing, the
   patient was treated with antibiotics and a prednisone taper.
   .
   During the hospitalization she had a 20 second asystolic episode,
   likely secondary to vagal episode.  Code blue was called but patient
   quickly recovered blood pressure, heart rate and respirations without
   intervention.  Review of telemetry appeared to have sinus bradycardia
   and slowing before 20sec pause then sinus tachycardia with recovering
   of pulse. A PPM was placed.
   .
   The patient has done well in subsequent follow up.  She may have had a
   recent hospitalization from God Samaritan Medical Center with a recent
   CHF exacerbation.  Per report, she had complaints of 2 days of
   shortness of breath, with sudden worsening the day of presentation.
   Notes say that her symptoms worse with laying flat  The patient actived
   EMS, and on their arrival vitals of HR 132, BP 200/80, RR 24, 88% on
   unknown oxygen.  She was described as having pursed lips, audible
   wheezes, and respiratory distress.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 719**]
   for further evaluation. While at [**Hospital3 719**], her O2 sats were
   reported at 100%.  She became apneic and unresponsive.  After a
   difficult intubation, she was successfully intubated, and transferred
   to [**Hospital1 17**] for further evaluation.

   HPI:
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with a PMH of afib who presents from home after a fall.
   History is obtained from patient's wife as patient is intubated.  Per
   the patient's wife he was in his USOH today, eating a meal when he got
   up from the table.  He usually walks with a walker, however he was not
   using it at the time.  She heard a thud and turned and found her
   husband on the floor.  She does not think that he lost consciousness.
   There was no witnessed seizure activity.  He was not complaining of
   chest pain, SOB, palpitations, abdominal pain or nausea prior to the
   fall. Per the patient's wife he has not been recently ill.  EMS was
   called and he was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 76**].  At the OSH he was found to
   have slowed speech and confusion.  He complained of right hip pain.  A
   head CT was attempted and in the scanner the patient had witnessed
   vomiting, aspiration and respiratory arrest.  He was intubated.  CXR
   showed bilateral infiltrates and he was given levo/flagyl and vanco.
   He also received morphine 2mg, etomodate, versed 1mg x3 and 3L IVF.
   Head CT was then obtained and was reportedly negative.  He was then
   transferred here for further care.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals: T 98.4  HR 63  BP 107/47
   RR 28.  He continued to be unresponsive despite no further sedating
   medications.  Due to concern for stroke he was evaluated by neurology
   who felt that a primary neurologic event was less likely and concern
   for hypoxic injury was raised.  Hip films were negative for fracture.
   He was placed in c-collar for narrowing in his c-spine, however there
   was no fracture.  He was given 1L IVF and admitted to the MICU for
   further management.

   HPI:
   51 y.o. female with a past medical history of remote Hodgkin's s/p
   treatment and staging laparotomy and splenectomy as well as a history
   of PEs, at least one of which required TPA who is being transferred
   from [**State 4101**]Hospital to be evaluated for a liver transplant. On
   [**6-18**], at NEBH, patient underwent bilateral C6-7 laminoforaminotomies
   and C5-7 posterior cervical spinal instrumented fusion with left
   posterior iliac crest bone graft harvest through a separate incision
   for cervical spondylosis. She reportedly tolerated the procedure well.
   On [**6-20**], she then presented to [**Hospital3 **] with an acute change in
   mental status in the setting of hypotension with SBP in the 80s and a
   leukocytosis of 19 with 5% bands and lactate of 5.2 along with a
   positive UA and bibasilar infiltrates on CXR. Labs were also notable
   for acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3 and a troponin of 17,
   the latter of which led her to receive ASA and Plavix. She was given
   Levofloxacin empirically and then transferred to [**State 6498**]Hospital's MICU for further management of presumed sepsis. While at
   [**Location 6499**], patient was fluid resuscitated with improvement
   in her BP after 3 L of normal saline (seemingly never requiring
   pressors), received supportive care for her renal failure with
   Kayexalate and calcium for hyperkalemia. Creatinine however increased
   to 4 with decrease in UOP to less than 5 ccs/hour. Antibiotics for
   presumed sepsis were initiated with broad coverage through Zyvox and
   Aztreonam as patient has multiple antibiotic allergies. Culture data at
   the time of transfer was unrevealing. Cardiac enzymes were followed and
   trended down to 14 (troponin, but CKs not checked). A TTE was performed
   which was very limited and commented on possible enlarged RV. Chest CT
   without contrast commented on possible dissection, but follow-up MRI
   showed no dissection. Given AST of [**Numeric Identifier 6500**] and ALT of [**Numeric Identifier 6501**], INR of 2.7
   with worsening mental status, GI was consulted and was concerned for
   significant encephalopathy (grade 3). She was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for consideration of liver transplant and in the interim once accepted,
   was intubated to protect her airway.

   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 73**])
   Assessment:
   Pt most likely  became  fatigued in the setting of metabolic acidosis
   and attempt to hyperventilate to compensate requiring her to be
   intubated. Placed pt on 40% cpap with 5 peep and ps of 5 . lungs
   essentially clear on auscultation. Suctioned for sm amts of thick tan
   sputum.cxr c/w fluid overload which is likely contributing to the
   difficulty in weaning her off the vent.once pt is weaned off pressors
   will then need diuresis and hopefully pt will start to mobilize fluid.
   Action:
   Vent  weaned to 40%cpap with 5 peep and ps of 5. resp status monitored
   closely. Antibiotics administered as ordered. Reps toileting continues.
   Decision made not to extubate pt since she became tachypneic ,had lower
   tv

   residing in a nursing home  found unresponsive in vomitus and asystolic
   this morning, apenic and cyanotic, he had made some gasping efforts.
   He was seen 10 minutes earlier and in no distress and at baseline.
   Apparently nursing staff noted him to be apenic and placed an AED which
   advised ""no shock"" and called EMS.  By EMS he was noted to be in a PEA
   arrest with a narrow complex tachycardia at a rate of around 100.  He
   was given epi and atropine x 2 doses each.  He never regained a pulse
   during his transport.  By the time he arrived at [**Hospital3 **] he was
   again noted to be in PEA arrest with a rate of 170-180 with occasional
   triplets of PVCs.  He was given 1mg of epi, 1 amp of bicarb and 1g of
   magnesium (for the ectopy) and he regained a pulse with a SBP of 100.
   His perfusing rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 with
   reportedly no ischemic changes on his EKG.

   The patient had been intubated in the field and in the ER there had
   been vomitus in the ET tube.  The patient was initially vented at AC
   500 x 14 with a PEEP of 5 and FiO2 of 100%.  His ABG on this was 7.1 /
   52 / 510.  At this point his FiO2 was decreased to 40%, a CXR revealed
   some scarring at the R base of the patient's lung, also the ET tube was
   at the carina and was pulled back 2 cm. In transport with [**Location (un) 1038**],

   See prior MICU note and floor transfer note for additional details.
   Briefly, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10015**] is a 67 yo M with PMH of sCHF EF 20%, HTN,
   mechanical AVR who was initially admitted on [**2708-12-20**] from rehab after
   recent partial colectomy for ischemic bowel for hypotension and likely
   PNA.  During his first ICU stay he was briefly on pressors and quickly
   weaned off of them. His PICC line was d/c'ed. He received 2 units of
   blood for an hct of 22 and bumped appropriately.  CT negative for
   bleeding. Diuretics were held in setting of hypotension and he received
   a small fluid bolus for bp's to the 90's and responded well.  Echo
   showed baseline EF of 25% and new moderate pulmonary artery
   hypertension.  CXR showed new RM/RLL opacity.
   He was transferred to the floor last night. His diuretics and ACEi were
   written to be restarted this morning as he was crackly on exam last
   night and more so this morning.  He didn't receive them prior to his
   decompensation.  This morning [**12-25**] at 9:30 he became acutely short of
   breath and hypoxic to 72% on a NRB from presumed flash pulmonary edema
   while on the bed pan. A code was called and patient was emergently
   intubated by anesthesia.  He received Lasix 60mg iv with 40cc of urine

471,"Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10499**] is a 54yo M w/hx ESRD with failed tx on PD, DM-I, CAD, CHF
   with EF ~15% who presents to the ED with hypotension.  He ""thinks"" that
   he took too much off with PD at home today but cannot quantify exact
   amount. He states he usually takes off 1500ml but knows it was a lot
   higher than this number.
   .
   Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (2) 11961**] for cellulitis and
   abscess of the R thigh which was I&D'd on [**4-28**].  He was treated
   initially with Vanc/Unasyn, then changed to Unasyn when cultures came
   back with MSSA.  He was discharged on Augmentin for a further 10 day
   course to end [**2866-5-13**].
   .
   In the ER, initial vitals were T98.6F, HR 74, BP 70/37, RR 17 and
   oxygen sat 99% RA.  Blood pressures dropped to 56 systolic and he was
   given 2L NS and systolics came up to 70s-80, so he was placed on
   peripheral dopamine.  He was given vanc/zosyn in the ED for broad
   coverage, with particular concern for cellulitis spread / abscesses in
   legs. Renal was consulted and will plan to follow patient as inpatient.
   His PD fluid was sent for culture and cytology.  Cell count from the PD
   fluid showed 50 WBCs and 9% polys.  ECG showed ST depressions
   anterolaterally which are similar to prior ECGs.  He had a central line
   placed for access to continue monitoring hemodynamics and for easy
   pressor use.
   .
   On evaluation in the MICU, patient was very lethargic and attention
   waxed and waned during exam. He seemed to be in no acute distress or
   pain. Arrived with right IJ in place and was on dopamine pressor with
   blood pressures stable at 118/67.
